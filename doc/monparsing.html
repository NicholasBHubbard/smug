Abstract:
</p>
<p>
In functional programming, a popular approach to building recursive
descent parsers is to model parsers as functions, and to define
higher-order functions (or combinators) that implement grammar
constructions such as sequencing, choice, and repetition. Such parsers
form an instance of a monad , an algebraic structure from mathematics
that has proved useful for addressing a number of computational
problems. The purpose of this article is to provide a step-by-step
tutorial on the monadic approach to building functional parsers, and
to explain some of the benefits that result from exploiting monads. No
prior knowledge of parser combinators or of monads is assumed. Indeed,
this article can also be viewed as a first introduction to the use of
monads in programming.

<p>
In functional programming, a popular approach to building recursive
descent parsers is to model parsers as functions, and to define
higher-order functions (or combinators) that implement grammar
constructions such as sequencing, choice, and repetition. The basic
idea dates back to at least Burge’s book on recursive programming
techniques (Burge, 1975), and has been popularised in functional
programming by Wadler (1985), Hutton (1992), Fokker (1995), and
others. Combinators provide a quick and easy method of building
functional parsers. Moreover, the method has the advantage over
functional parser generators such as Ratatosk (Mogensen, 1993) and
Happy (Gill &amp; Marlow, 1995) that one has the full power of a
functional language available to define new combinators for special
applications (Landin, 1966).
</p>
<p>
It was realised early on (Wadler, 1990) that parsers form an instance
of a monad , an algebraic structure from mathematics that has proved
useful for addressing a number of computational problems (Moggi, 1989;
Wadler, 1990; Wadler, 1992a; Wadler, 1992b). As well as being
interesting from a mathematical point of view, recognising the monadic
nature of parsers also brings practical benefits. For example, using a
monadic sequencing combinator for parsers avoids the messy
manipulation of nested tuples of results present in earlier
work. Moreover, using monad comprehension notation makes parsers more
compact and easier to read.
</p>
<p>
Taking the monadic approach further, the monad of parsers can be expressed in
a modular way in terms of two simpler monads. The immediate benefit is that the
basic parser combinators no longer need to be defined explicitly. Rather, they arise
automatically as a special case of lifting monad operations from a base monad m
to a certain other monad parameterised over m. This also means that, if we change
the nature of parsers by modifying the base monad (for example, limiting parsers
to producing at most one result), then new combinators for the modified monad of
parsers also arise automatically via the lifting construction.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this article is to provide a step-by-step tutorial on
the monadic approach to building functional parsers, and to explain
some of the benefits that result from exploiting monads. Much of the
material is already known. Our contributions are the organisation of
the material into a tutorial article; the introduction of new
combinators for handling lexical issues without a separate lexer; and
a new approach to implementing the offside rule, inspired by the use of
monads.  Some prior exposure to functional programming would be
helpful in reading this article, but special features of Gofer (Jones,
1995b) — our implementation language — are explained as they are
used. Any other lazy functional language that supports
(multi-parameter) constructor classes and the use of monad
comprehension notation would do equally well. No prior knowledge of
parser combinators or monads is assumed. Indeed, this article can also
be viewed as a first introduction to the use of monads in
programming. A library of monadic parser combinators taken from this
article is available from the authors, via the World-Wide-Web.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Combinator parsers</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
We begin by reviewing the basic ideas of combinator parsing (Wadler, 1985; Hutton,
1992; Fokker, 1995). In particular, we define a type for parsers, three primitive
parsers, and two primitive combinators for building larger parsers.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> The type of parsers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">


<p>
Let us start by thinking of a parser as a function that takes a string of characters as
input and yields some kind of tree as result, with the intention that the tree makes
explicit the grammatical structure of the string:
</p>



<pre class="example">type Parser = String -&gt; Tree
</pre>


<p>
In general, however, a parser might not consume all of its input string, so rather
than the result of a parser being just a tree, we also return the unconsumed suffix
of the input string. Thus we modify our type of parsers as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">type Parser = String -&gt; (Tree,String)
</pre>


<p>
Similarly, a parser might fail on its input string. Rather than just reporting a
run-time error if this happens, we choose to have parsers return a list of pairs
rather than a single pair, with the convention that the empty list denotes failure of
a parser, and a singleton list denotes success:
</p>



<pre class="example">type Parser = String -&gt; [(Tree,String)]
</pre>


<p>
Having an explicit representation of failure and returning the unconsumed part
of the input string makes it possible to define combinators for building up parsers
piecewise from smaller parsers. Returning a list of results opens up the possibility
of returning more than one result if the input string can be parsed in more than
one way, which may be the case if the underlying grammar is ambiguous.
Finally, different parsers will likely return different kinds of trees, so it is useful
to abstract on the specific type Tree of trees, and make the type of result values
into a parameter of the Parser type:
</p>



<pre class="example">type Parser a = String -&gt; [(a,String)]
</pre>


<p>
This is the type of parsers we will use in the remainder of this article. One could
go further (as in (Hutton, 1992), for example) and abstract upon the type String
of tokens, but we do not have need for this generalisation here.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Primitive parsers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
The three primitive parsers defined in this section are the building
blocks of combinator parsing. The first parser is result v, which
succeeds without consuming any of the input string, and returns the
single result v:
</p>



<pre class="example">result :: a -&gt; Parser a
result v = \inp -&gt; [(v,inp)]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun result (value)
  (lambda (input) 
    (list (cons value input))))
</pre>



<pre class="example">(assert (equal '((1 . "asd"))
               (funcall (result 1) "asd")))
</pre>


<p>
An expression of the form <b>\x -&gt; e</b> is called a λ-abstraction, and
denotes the function that takes an argument x and returns the value of
the expression e. Thus result v is the function that takes an input
string inp and returns the singleton list [(v,inp)]. This function
could equally well be defined by result v inp = [(v,inp)], but we
prefer the above definition (in which the argument inp is shunted to
the body of the definition) because it corresponds more closely to the
type result :: a -&gt; Parser a, which asserts that result is a function
that takes a single argument and returns a parser.
</p>
<p>
Dually, the parser zero always fails, regardless of the input string:
</p>



<pre class="example">zero :: Parser a
zero = \inp -&gt; []
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun zero ()
 (constantly NIL))
</pre>



<pre class="example">(assert (eq NIL (funcall (zero) "asd")))
</pre>


<p>
Our final primitive is item, which successfully consumes the first character if the
input string is non-empty, and fails otherwise:
</p>



<pre class="example">item :: Parser Char
item = \inp -&gt; case inp of
                [] -&gt; []
                (x:xs) -&gt; [(x,xs)]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun item ()
  (lambda (input)
    (etypecase input 
      (null nil)
      (string
       (unless (equal input "")
         (list (cons (aref input 0)
                     (subseq input 1))))))))
</pre>



<pre class="example">(assert (equal '((#\a . "sd"))
               (funcall (item) "asd")))

(assert (equal '((#\a . ""))
               (funcall (item) "a")))

(assert (null
         (funcall (item) "")))
</pre>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">


<p>
The primitive parsers defined above are not very useful in
themselves. In this section we consider how they can be glued together
to form more useful parsers. We take our lead from the BNF notation
for specifying grammars, in which larger grammars are built up
piecewise from smaller grammars using a sequencing operator — denoted
by juxtaposition — and a choice operator — denoted by a vertical
bar |.
</p>
<p>
We define corresponding operators for combining parsers, such that the
structure of our parsers closely follows the structure of the
underlying grammars.
</p>
<p>
In earlier (non-monadic) accounts of combinator parsing (Wadler, 1985; Hutton,
1992; Fokker, 1995), sequencing of parsers was usually captured by a combinator
</p>




<pre class="example">seq     :: Parser a -&gt; Parser b -&gt; Parser (a,b)
p ‘seq‘ q = \inp -&gt; [((v,w),inp’’) | (v,inp’) &lt;- p inp
                                   , (w,inp’’) &lt;- q inp’]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun sequence (parser1 parser2)
  (lambda (input)
    (loop :for (result-1 . input-1) 
       :in (funcall parser1 input)
       :append 
       (loop :for (result-2 . input-2)
          :in (funcall parser2 input-1)
          :collect 
          (cons 
           (cons result-1 result-2)
           input-2)))))          
</pre>



<pre class="example">(assert 
 (equal '(((#\a . #\s) . "d"))
        (funcall (sequence (item) (item)) "asd")))
</pre>


<p>  
that applies one parser after another, with the results from the two
parsers being combined as pairs. The infix notation p ‘seq‘ q is
syntactic sugar for seq p q; any function of two arguments can used as
an infix operator in this way, by enclosing its name in backquotes. At
first sight, the seq combinator might seem a natural composition
primitive. In practice, however, using seq leads to parsers with
nested tuples as results, which are messy to manipulate.
</p>
<p>
The problem of nested tuples can be avoided by adopting a monadic sequencing
combinator (commonly known as bind) which integrates the sequencing of parsers
with the processing of their result values:
</p>



<pre class="example">bind :: Parser a -&gt; (a -&gt; Parser b) -&gt; Parser b
p ‘bind‘ f = \inp -&gt; concat [f v inp’ | (v,inp’) &lt;- p inp]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun bind (parser function)
  (lambda (input)
    (loop :for (value . input) 
       :in (funcall parser input)
       :append (funcall (funcall function value) input))))
</pre>


<p>
The definition for bind can be interpreted as follows. First of all,
the parser p is applied to the input string, yielding a list of
(value,string) pairs. Now since f is a function that takes a value and
returns a parser, it can be applied to each value (and unconsumed
input string) in turn. This results in a list of lists of
(value,string) pairs, that can then be flattened to a single list using
concat.
</p>
<p>
The bind combinator avoids the problem of nested tuples of results
because the results of the first parser are made directly available
for processing by the second, rather than being paired up with the
other results to be processed later on. A typical parser built using
bind has the following structure
</p>



<pre class="example">p1 ‘bind‘ \x1 -&gt;
p2 ‘bind‘ \x2 -&gt;
...
pn ‘bind‘ \xn -&gt;
result (f x1 x2 ... xn)
</pre>




<br/>


<pre class="example">(bind 
 p1 
 (lambda (x1)
   (bind 
    p2 
    (lambda (x2) 
      #| ... |#
      (bind 
       pn
       (lambda (xn)
         (result (f  x1 x2 #|...|# xn))))))))

</pre>


<p>
and can be read operationally as follows: apply parser p1 and call its
result value x1; then apply parser p2 and call its result value x2;
. . .; then apply the parser pn and call its result value xn; and
finally, combine all the results into a single value by applying the
function f. For example, the seq combinator can be defined by
</p>



<pre class="example">p ‘seq‘ q = p ‘bind‘ \x -&gt;
q ‘bind‘ \y -&gt;
result (x,y)
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun sequence (parser-1 parser-2)
  (bind parser-1 
        (lambda (x)
     (bind parser-2 
           (lambda (y) 
             (result (cons x y)))))))
</pre>


<p>
(On the other hand, bind cannot be defined in terms of seq.)
</p>



<pre class="example">(let* ((p1 (item))
       (p2 (result 'yay!))
       (pn (sequence 
            (item) (result 'two-much-yay!))))
  (assert (equal '(((#\A YAY! 
                     (#\S . TWO-MUCH-YAY!)) 
                    . "D"))
                 (funcall (|lisp test bind|
                           p1 p2 pn) "ASD"))))  
</pre>


<p>
Using the bind combinator, we are now able to define some simple but useful
parsers. Recall that the item parser consumes a single character unconditionally. In
practice, we are normally only interested in consuming certain specific characters.
For this reason, we use item to define a combinator sat that takes a predicate (a
Boolean valued function), and yields a parser that consumes a single character if it
satisfies the predicate, and fails otherwise:
</p>



<pre class="example">sat :: (Char -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Parser Char
sat p = item ‘bind‘ \x -&gt;
if p x then result x else zero
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun satisfies (predicate)
  (bind (item) 
        (lambda (x)
          (if (funcall predicate x)
              (result x)
              (zero)))))
</pre>


<p>
Note that if item fails (that is, if the input string is empty), then so does sat p,
since it can readily be observed that zero ‘bind‘ f = zero for all functions f of
the appropriate type. Indeed, this equation is not specific to parsers: it holds for
an arbitrary monad with a zero (Wadler, 1992a; Wadler, 1992b). Monads and their
connection to parsers will be discussed in the next section.
</p>
<p>
Using sat, we can define parsers for specific characters, single digits, lower-case
letters, and upper-case letters:
</p>



<pre class="example">char :: Char -&gt; Parser Char
char x = sat (\y -&gt; x == y)

digit :: Parser Char
digit = sat (\x -&gt; ’0’ &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= ’9’)

lower :: Parser Char
lower = sat (\x -&gt; ’a’ &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= ’z’)

upper :: Parser Char
upper = sat (\x -&gt; ’A’ &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= ’Z’)
</pre>


<blockquote>



</blockquote>





<pre class="example">
(defun char (x)
 (satisfies (lambda (y) (char= x y))))

(defun digit ()
  (satisfies (lambda (x) 
               (and (char&lt;= #\0 x)
                    (char&gt;= #\9 x)))))

(defun lower ()
  (satisfies (lambda (x) 
               (and (char&lt;= #\a x)
                    (char&gt;= #\z x)))))

(defun upper ()
  (satisfies (lambda (x) 
               (and (char&lt;= #\A x)
                    (char&gt;= #\Z x)))))

</pre>


<p>
For example, applying the parser <b>upper</b> to the input string
<b>&shy;"Hello"&shy;</b> succeeds with the single successful result
<b>[(’H’,"ello")]</b>, since the upper parser succeeds with <b>’H’</b> as the
result value and <b>&shy;"ello"&shy;</b> as the unconsumed suffix of the
input. On the other hand, applying the parser lower to the string
<b>&shy;"Hello"&shy;</b> fails with <b>[]</b> as the result, since <b>’H’</b> is not a lower-case
letter.
</p>



<pre class="example">(assert (equal '((#\H . "ello"))
          (funcall (upper) "Hello")))

(assert (cl:null 
          (funcall (lower) "Hello")))
</pre>


<p>
As another example of using bind, consider the parser that accepts two
lower-case letters in sequence, returning a string of length two:
</p>



<pre class="example">lower ‘bind‘ \x -&gt;
lower ‘bind‘ \y -&gt;
result [x,y]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(bind 
 (lower) 
 (lambda (x) 
   (bind 
    (lower) 
    (lambda (y) 
      (result (coerce (list x y) 'string))))))    
</pre>


<p>
Applying this parser to the string "abcd" succeeds with the result
<b>[("ab","cd")]</b>.  Applying the same parser to <b>&shy;"aBcd&shy;</b> fails with the
result <b>[]</b>, because even though the initial letter <b>’a’</b> can be
consumed by the first lower parser, the following letter <b>’B’</b> cannot be
consumed by the second lower parser.
</p>



<pre class="example">(assert (equal '(("ab" . "cd"))
               (funcall (|lisp test string of length two|) 
                        "abcd"))) 
(assert (cl:null (funcall (|lisp test string of length two|) 
                          "aBcd")))
</pre>


<p>
Of course, the above parser for two letters in sequence can be generalised to a
parser for arbitrary strings of lower-case letters. Since the length of the string to
be parsed cannot be predicted in advance, such a parser will naturally be defined
recursively, using a choice operator to decide between parsing a single letter and
recursing, or parsing nothing further and terminating. A suitable choice combinator
for parsers, plus, is defined as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">plus :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a -&gt; Parser a
p ‘plus‘ q = \inp -&gt; (p inp ++ q inp)
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun plus (parser qarser)
  (lambda (input) 
    (append (funcall parser input)
            (funcall qarser input))))
</pre>


<p>
That is, both argument parsers p and q are applied to the same input string, and
their result lists are concatenated to form a single result list. Note that it is not
required that p and q accept disjoint sets of strings: if both parsers succeed on
the input string then more than one result value will be returned, reflecting the
different ways that the input string can be parsed.
</p>
<p>
As examples of using plus, some of our earlier parsers can now be combined to
give parsers for letters and alpha-numeric characters:
</p>



<pre class="example">letter :: Parser Char
letter = lower ‘plus‘ upper

alphanum :: Parser Char
alphanum = letter ‘plus‘ digit
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun letter () (plus (lower) (upper)))
(defun alphanum () (plus (letter) (digit)))
</pre>


<p>
More interestingly, a parser for words (strings of letters) is defined
by
</p>



<pre class="example">word :: Parser String
word = neWord ‘plus‘ result ""
where
neWord = letter ‘bind‘ \x -&gt;
  word ‘bind‘ \xs -&gt;
  result (x:xs)
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun word ()
  (flet ((ne-word ()
          (bind 
          (letter) 
          (lambda (x) 
          (bind (word) (lambda (xs) (result (cons x xs))))))))
  (plus (ne-word) (result nil))))
</pre>


<p>
That is, word either parses a non-empty word (a single letter followed by a word,
using a recursive call to word), in which case the two results are combined to form
a string, or parses nothing and returns the empty string.
</p>
<p>
For example, applying word to the input "Yes!" gives the result [("Yes","!"),
("Ye","s!"), ("Y","es!"), ("","Yes!")]. The first result, ("Yes","!"), is the
expected result: the string of letters "Yes" has been consumed, and the unconsumed
input is "!". In the subsequent results a decreasing number of letters are consumed.
</p>



<pre class="example">
(assert (equal (funcall (word) "Yes!")
                  '(((#\Y #\e #\s) . "!") 
                    ((#\Y #\e) . "s!") 
                    ((#\Y) . "es!")
                    (NIL . "Yes!"))))

</pre>


<p>
This behaviour arises because the choice operator plus is non-deterministic: both
alternatives can be explored, even if the first alternative is successful. Thus, at each
application of letter, there is always the option to just finish parsing, even if there
are still letters left to be consumed from the start of the input.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Parsers and monads</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
Later on we will define a number of useful parser combinators in terms
of the primitive parsers and combinators just defined. But first we
turn our attention to the monadic nature of combinator parsers.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> The parser monad</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">

<p>So far, we have defined (among others) the following two operations on
parsers:
</p>



<pre class="example">result :: a -&gt; Parser a
bind :: Parser a -&gt; (a -&gt; Parser b) -&gt; Parser b
</pre>



<pre class="example">


</pre>


<p>
Generalising from the specific case of Parser to some arbitrary type
constructor M gives the notion of a monad: a monad is a type
constructor M (a function from types to types), together with
operations result and bind of the following types:
</p>



<pre class="example">result :: a -&gt; M a
bind :: M a -&gt; (a -&gt; M b) -&gt; M b
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defgeneric result (&lt;monad&gt; value))
(defgeneric bind (&lt;monad&gt; monadic-value monadic-function))
</pre>


<p>
Thus, parsers form a monad for which M is the Parser type constructor,
and result and bind are defined as previously. Technically, the two
operations of a monad must also satisfy a few algebraic properties,
but we do not concern ourselves with such properties here; see
(Wadler, 1992a; Wadler, 1992b) for more details.
</p>
<p>
Readers familiar with the categorical definition of a monad may have
expected two operations <b>map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (M a -&gt; M b)</b> and <b>join :: M (M a) -&gt; M</b> a in place of the single operation bind. However, our
definition is equivalent to the categorical one (Wadler, 1992a;
Wadler, 1992b), and has the advantage that bind generally proves more
convenient for monadic programming than map and join.
</p>
<p>
Parsers are not the only example of a monad. Indeed, we will see later
on how the parser monad can be re-formulated in terms of two simpler
monads. This raises the question of what to do about the naming of the
monadic combinators result and bind. In functional languages based
upon the Hindley-Milner typing system (for example, Miranda1 and
Standard ML) it is not possible to use the same names for the
combinators of different monads. Rather, one would have to use
different names, such as resultM and bindM, for the combinators of
each monad M.
</p>
<p>
Gofer, however, extends the Hindley-Milner typing system with an
overloading mechanism that permits the use of the same names for the
combinators of different monads. Under this overloading mechanism, the
appropriate monad for each use of a name is calculated automatically
during type inference.  Overloading in Gofer is accomplished by the
use of classes (Jones, 1995c). A class for monads can be declared in
Gofer by: 
</p>



<pre class="example">class Monad m where 
result :: a -&gt; m a 
bind:: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
</pre>



<pre class="example">
(define-interface &lt;monad&gt; (&lt;interface&gt;)
  ()
  (:generic result (&lt;interface&gt; value))
  (:generic bind (&lt;interface&gt; monadic-value monadic-function)))

</pre>


<p>
This declaration can be read as follows: a type constructor m is a member of the
class Monad if it is equipped with result and bind operations of the specified types.
The fact that m must be a type constructor (rather than just a type) is inferred
from its use in the types for the operations.
</p>



<pre class="example">(macroexpand-1 
 '(define-interface &lt;monad&gt; (&lt;interface&gt;)
   ()
   (:generic result (&lt;interface&gt; value))
   (:generic bind (&lt;interface&gt; monadic-value monadic-function))))
;; =&gt; 
(PROGN
 (DEFCLASS &lt;MONAD&gt; (&lt;INTERFACE&gt;) NIL)
 (DEFGENERIC RESULT
     (&lt;INTERFACE&gt; VALUE))
 (DEFGENERIC BIND
     (&lt;INTERFACE&gt; MONADIC-VALUE MONADIC-FUNCTION))
 (DEFMETHOD INTERFACE-OPTIONS APPEND ((&lt;I&gt; &lt;MONAD&gt;))
   '((:GENERIC RESULT (&lt;INTERFACE&gt; VALUE))
     (:GENERIC BIND (&lt;INTERFACE&gt; MONADIC-VALUE MONADIC-FUNCTION)))))
</pre>


<p>
Now the type constructor Parser can be made into an instance of the
class Monad using the result and bind from the previous section:
</p>



<pre class="example">instance Monad Parser where 
-- result :: a -&gt; Parser a result v = \inp
-&gt; [(v,inp)] -- bind
:: Parser a -&gt; (a -&gt; Parser b) -&gt; Parser b
p ‘bind‘ f = \inp -&gt; concat [f v out | (v,out) &lt;- p inp]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(define-interface &lt;parser&gt; (&lt;monad&gt;) 
  ()
  (:singleton))
</pre>



<pre class="example">(macroexpand-1 
 '(define-interface &lt;parser&gt; (&lt;monad&gt;) 
   ()
   (:singleton)))
;; =&gt;
(PROGN
 (DEFCLASS &lt;PARSER&gt; (&lt;MONAD&gt;) NIL)
 (DEFVAR &lt;PARSER&gt; (MAKE-INSTANCE '&lt;PARSER&gt;))
 (DEFMETHOD INTERFACE-OPTIONS APPEND ((&lt;I&gt; &lt;PARSER&gt;)) '((:SINGLETON))))

</pre>



<pre class="example">(defmethod result ((&lt;p&gt; &lt;parser&gt;) value)
  (lambda (input) (list (cons value input))))

(defmethod bind ((&lt;p&gt; &lt;parser&gt;) parser function)
  (lambda (input)
    (loop :for (value . input) 
       :in (funcall parser input)
       :append (funcall (funcall function value) input))))
</pre>



<p>
We pause briefly here to address a couple of technical points
concerning Gofer.  First of all, type synonyms such as Parser must be
supplied with all their arguments. Hence the instance declaration
above is not actually valid Gofer code, since Parser is used in the
first line without an argument. The problem is easy to solve (redefine
Parser using data rather than type, or as a restricted type synonym),
but for simplicity we prefer in this article just to assume that type
synonyms can be partially applied. The second point is that the syntax
of Gofer does not currently allow the types of the defined functions
in instance declarations to be explicitly specified. But for clarity,
as above, we include such types in comments.
</p>
<p>
Let us turn now to the following operations on parsers:
</p>



<pre class="example">zero :: Parser a
plus :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a -&gt; Parser a
</pre>



<p>
Generalising once again from the specific case of the Parser type constructor, we
arrive at the notion of a monad with a zero and a plus, which can be encapsulated
using the Gofer class system in the following manner:
</p>



<pre class="example">class Monad m =&gt; Monad0Plus m where
zero :: m a
(++) :: m a -&gt; m a -&gt; m a
</pre>



<pre class="example">(define-interface &lt;zero-plus&gt; (&lt;interface&gt;)
  ()
  (:generic zero (&lt;interface&gt;))
  (:generic plus (&lt;interface&gt; 
                  interface-value-1
                  interface-value-2)))

(define-interface &lt;monad-zero-plus&gt; (&lt;monad&gt; &lt;zero-plus&gt;)
    ()
    (:generic guard (&lt;interface&gt; 
                     predicate value
                     &amp;rest predicate-args)))

</pre>


<p>
That is, a type constructor m is a member of the class Monad0Plus if
it is a member of the class Monad (that is, it is equipped with a
result and bind), and if it is also equipped with zero and (++)
operators of the specified types. Of course, the two extra operations
must also satisfy some algebraic properties; these are discussed in
(Wadler, 1992a; Wadler, 1992b). Note also that (++) is used above
rather than plus, following the example of lists: we will see later on
that lists form a monad for which the plus operation is just the
familiar append operation (++).
</p>
<p>
Now since Parser is already a monad, it can be made into a monad with a zero
and a plus using the following definitions:
</p>



<pre class="example">instance Monad0Plus Parser where
-- zero :: Parser a
zero
= \inp -&gt; []
-- (++) :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a -&gt; Parser a
p ++ q
= \inp -&gt; (p inp ++ q inp)
</pre>



<pre class="example">(define-interface &lt;parser&gt; (&lt;monad-zero-plus&gt;) 
  ()
  (:singleton)
  (:generic item (&lt;parser&gt;)))

(defgeneric item-input (&lt;parser&gt; input)
  (:method ((&lt;p&gt; &lt;parser&gt;) (input cl:null))
    input)
  (:method ((&lt;p&gt; &lt;parser&gt;) (input cl:string))
    (unless (cl:string= input "")
      (list 
       (cons (aref input 0) 
             (multiple-value-bind (array displaced-index-offset) 
                 (array-displacement input) 
               (let ((string (or array input))
                     (index (if array (1+ displaced-index-offset) 1)))
                 (make-array (1- (length input))
                             :displaced-to string
                             :displaced-index-offset index
                             :element-type (array-element-type string)))))))))

(defmethod item ((&lt;p&gt; &lt;parser&gt;))
  (lambda (input)
    (item-input &lt;p&gt; input)))
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defmethod zero ((&lt;p&gt; &lt;parser&gt;))
   (constantly NIL))

(defmethod plus ((&lt;p&gt; &lt;parser&gt;) parser qarser)
  (lambda (input)
    (append (funcall parser input) (funcall qarser input))))
</pre>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">


<p>
So far we have seen one advantage of recognising the monadic nature of
parsers: the monadic sequencing combinator bind handles result values
better than the conventional sequencing combinator seq. In this
section we consider another advantage of the monadic approach, namely
that monad comprehension syntax can be used to make parsers more
compact and easier to read.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, many parsers will have a structure as a sequence of binds
followed by single call to result:
</p>



<pre class="example">p1 ‘bind‘
p2 ‘bind‘
...
pn ‘bind‘
result (f \x1 -&gt; \x2 -&gt; \xn -&gt;
x1 x2 ... xn)
</pre>



<p>
Gofer provides a special notation for defining parsers of this shape,
allowing them to be expressed in the following, more appealing form:
</p>



<pre class="example">[ f x1 x2 ... xn | x1 &lt;- p1
, x2 &lt;- p2
, ...
, xn &lt;- pn ]
</pre>

</pre>


<p>
In fact, this notation is not specific to parsers, but can be used
with any monad (Jones, 1995c). The reader might notice the similarity
to the list comprehension notation supported by many functional
languages. It was Wadler (1990) who first observed that the
comprehension notation is not particular to lists, but makes sense for
an arbitrary monad. Indeed, the algebraic properties required of the
monad operations turn out to be precisely those required for the
notation to make sense. To our knowledge, Gofer is the first language
to implement Wadler’s monad comprehension notation. Using this
notation can make parsers much easier to read, and we will use the
notation in the remainder of this article.
</p>
<p>
As our first example of using comprehension notation, we define a
parser for recognising specific strings, with the string itself
returned as the result:
</p>



<pre class="example">string :: String -&gt; Parser String
string "" = [""]
string (x:xs) = [x:xs | _ &lt;- char x, _ &lt;- string xs]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun string (string)
   (if (cl:string= string "")
       (result &lt;parser&gt; nil)
       (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; 
         ((_ (char (aref string 0)))
          (_ (string (subseq string 1))))
        (result string))))
</pre>


<p>
That is, if the string to be parsed is empty we just return the empty
string as the result; <b>[""]</b> is just monad comprehension syntax for
result "". Otherwise, we parse the first character of the string using
char, and then parse the remaining characters using a recursive call
to string. Without the aid of comprehension notation, the above
definition would read as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">string:: String -&gt; Parser String
string "" = result ""
string (x:xs) = char x
‘bind‘ \_ -&gt;
string xs ‘bind‘ \_ -&gt;
result (x:xs)
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun string (string)
  (if (cl:string= string "")
      (result &lt;parser&gt; nil)
      (bind 
       &lt;parser&gt;
       (char (aref string 0))
       (lambda (_) 
         (declare (ignore _))
         (bind 
          &lt;parser&gt;
          (string (subseq string 1))
          (lambda (_) 
            (declare (ignore _))         
            (result &lt;parser&gt; string)))))))

</pre>


<p>
Note that the parser string xs fails if only a prefix of the given
string xs is recognised in the input. For example, applying the parser
<b>&shy;string "hello"&shy;</b> to the input <b>&shy;"hello there"&shy;</b> gives the successful result
<b>[("hello"," there")]</b>. On the other hand, applying the same parser to
"helicopter" fails with the result [], even though the prefix "hel" of
the input can be recognised.
</p>



<pre class="example">(assert (equal '(("hello" . " there"))
               (funcall (string "hello") 
                        "hello there")))

(assert (cl:null (funcall (string "hello") 
                          "helicopter")))
</pre>


<p>
In list comprehension notation, we are not just restricted to generators that bind
variables to values, but can also use Boolean-valued guards that restrict the values
of the bound variables. For example, a function negs that selects all the negative
numbers from a list of integers can be expressed as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">negs:: [Int] -&gt; [Int]
negs xs = [x | x &lt;- xs, x &lt; 0]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defmethod guard ((&lt;m&gt; &lt;monad-zero-plus&gt;) 
                    predicate value
                    &amp;rest predicate-args)
    (if (apply predicate value predicate-args)
        (result &lt;m&gt; value)
        (zero &lt;m&gt;)))
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun negs (xs) 
  (mlet* &lt;list&gt; ((x xs))
    (guard #'&lt; x 0)))
</pre>


<p>
In this case, the expression x &lt; 0 is a guard that restricts the
variable x (bound by the generator x &lt;- xs) to only take on values
less than zero.
</p>
<p>
Wadler (1990) observed that the use of guards makes sense for an
arbitrary monad with a zero. The monad comprehension notation in Gofer
supports this use of guards. For example, the sat combinator
</p>



<pre class="example">sat :: (Char -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Parser Char
sat p = item ‘bind‘ \x -&gt;
if p x then result x else zero

</pre>


<p>
can be defined more succinctly using a comprehension with a guard:
</p>



<pre class="example">sat :: (Char -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Parser Char
sat p = [x | x &lt;- item, p x]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun satisfies (predicate &amp;rest args)
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; ((x (item)))
    (apply #'guard predicate x args)))  
</pre>


<p>
We conclude this section by noting that there is another notation that can be
used to make monadic programs easier to read: the so-called “do” notation (Jones,
1994; Jones &amp; Launchbury, 1994). For example, using this notation the combinators
string and sat can be defined as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">string:: String -&gt; Parser String
string "" = do { result "" }
string (x:xs) = do { char x ; string xs ; result (x:xs) }

sat :: (Char -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Parser Char
sat p = do { x &lt;- item ; if (p x) ; result x }
</pre>



<p>
The do notation has a couple of advantages over monad comprehension
notation: we are not restricted to monad expressions that end with a
use of result; and generators of the form &lt;- e that do not bind
variables can be abbreviated by e.  The do notation is supported by
Gofer, but monad expressions involving parsers typically end with a
use of result (to compute the result value from the parser), so the
extra generality is not really necessary in this case. For this
reason, and for simplicity, in this article we only use the
comprehension notation. It would be an easy task, however, to
translate our definitions into the do notation.

<p>
Parser generators such as Lex and Yacc (Aho et al., 1986) for
producing parsers written in C, and Ratatosk (Mogensen, 1993) and
Happy (Gill &amp; Marlow, 1995) for producing parsers written in Haskell,
typically offer a fixed set of combinators for describing grammars. In
contrast, with the method of building parsers as presented in this
article the set of combinators is completely extensible: parsers are
first-class values, and we have the full power of a functional language
at our disposal to define special combinators for special applications.
</p>
<p>
In this section we define combinators for a number of common patterns
of repetition. These combinators are not specific to parsers, but can
be used with an arbitrary monad with a zero and plus. For clarity,
however, we specialise the types of the combinators to the case of
parsers.  In subsequent sections we will introduce combinators for
other purposes, including handling lexical issues and Gofer’s offside
rule.

<p>
Earlier we defined a parser word for consuming zero or more letters
from the input string. Using monad comprehension notation, the
definition is:
</p>



<pre class="example">word :: Parser String
word = [x:xs | x &lt;- letter, xs &lt;- word] ++ [""]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun word ()
 (mlet* &lt;parser&gt;
  (plus (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; 
            ((x (letter))
             (xs (word)))
          (result (cons x xs)))           
        (result nil))))

</pre>


<p>
We can easily imagine a number of other parsers that exhibit a similar
structure to word. For example, parsers for strings of digits or
strings of spaces could be defined in precisely the same way, the only
difference being be that the component parser letter would be replaced
by either digit or char ’ ’. To avoid defining a number of different
parsers with a similar structure, we abstract on the pattern of
recursion in word and define a general combinator, many, that parses
sequences of items.  The combinator many applies a parser p zero or
more times to an input string.
</p>
<p>
The results from each application of p are returned in a list:
</p>



<pre class="example">many :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many p = [x:xs | x &lt;- p, xs &lt;- many p] ++ [[]]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun many (parser)
    (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; ()
      (plus (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; 
                ((x parser)
                 (xs (many parser)))
              (result (cons x xs)))
            (result nil))))
</pre>


<p>
Different parsers can be made by supplying different arguments parsers
p. For example, word can be defined just as many letter, and the other
parsers mentioned above by many digit and many (char ’ ’).
</p>



<pre class="example">(defun word ()
  (many (letter)))
</pre>


<p>
Just as the original word parser returns many results in general
(decreasing in the number of letters consumed from the input), so does
many p. Of course, in most cases we will only be interested in the
first parse from many p, in which p is successfully applied as many
times as possible. We will return to this point in the next section,
when we address the efficiency of parsers.
</p>
<p>
As another application of many, we can define a parser for
identifiers. For simplicity, we regard an identifier as a lower-case
letter followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters. It would be
easy to extend the definition to handle extra characters, such as
underlines or backquotes.
</p>



<pre class="example">ident :: Parser String
ident = [x:xs | x &lt;- lower, xs &lt;- many alphanum]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun ident ()
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; 
    ((x (lower))
     (xs (many (alphanum))))
   (result (cons x xs))))
</pre>


<p>
Sometimes we will only be interested in non-empty sequences of items. For this
reason we define a special combinator, many1, in terms of many:
</p>



<pre class="example">many1 :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many1 p = [x:xs | x &lt;- p, xs &lt;- many p]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun many1 (parser)
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt;
      ((x parser)
       (xs (many parser)))
    (result (cons x xs))))
</pre>



<p>
For example, applying many1 (char ’a’) to the input "aaab" gives the
result [("aaa","b"), ("aa","ab"), ("a","aab")], which is the same as
for many (char ’a’), except that the final pair ("", "aaab") is no
longer present. Note also that many1 p may fail, whereas many p always
succeeds.
</p>



<pre class="example">(assert (equal '(((#\a #\a #\a) . "b") 
                 ((#\a #\a) . "ab")
                 ((#\a) . "aab")
                 (NIL . "aaab"))
               (funcall (many (char #\a)) "aaab")))

(assert (equal '(((#\a #\a #\a) . "b") 
                 ((#\a #\a) . "ab") 
                 ((#\a) . "aab"))
               (funcall (many1 (char #\a)) "aaab")))  
</pre>


<p>
Using many1 we can define a parser for natural numbers:
</p>



<pre class="example">nat :: Parser Int
nat = [eval xs | xs &lt;- many1 digit]
where
eval xs = foldl1 op [ord x - ord ’0’ | x &lt;- xs]
m ‘op‘ n = 10*m + n
</pre>



<pre class="example">
(defun nat () 
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt;
   ((xs (many1 (digit))))
  (result (read-from-string (coerce xs 'cl:string)))))

</pre>



<pre class="example">(assert (equal '((124 . "") (12 . "4") (1 . "24")) 
               (funcall (nat) "124")))  
</pre>


<p>
In turn, nat can be used to define a parser for integers:
</p>



<pre class="example">int :: Parser Int
int = [-n | _ &lt;- char ’-’, n &lt;- nat] ++ nat
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun int ()
 (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; ()
   (plus (mlet* &lt;parser&gt;
             ((_ (char #\-))
              (n (nat)))
           (result (- n)))
         (nat))))  
</pre>



<pre class="example">(assert (and (equal (funcall (int) "12345")
                    '((12345 . "") (1234 . "5") (123 . "45") 
                      (12 . "345") (1 . "2345")))
             (equal (funcall (int) "-12345")
                    '((-12345 . "") (-1234 . "5") (-123 . "45") 
                      (-12 . "345") (-1 . "2345")))
             (cl:null (funcall (int) "#-12345"))))

</pre>


<p>
A more sophisticated way to define int is as follows. First try and
parse the negation character ’-’. If this is successful then return
the negation function as the result of the parse; otherwise return the
identity function. The final step is then to parse a natural number,
and use the function returned by attempting to parse the ’-’ character
to modify the resulting number:
</p>



<pre class="example">int :: Parser Int
int = [f n | f &lt;- op, n &lt;- nat]
where
op = [negate | _ &lt;- char ’-’] ++ [id]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun int ()
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; 
      ((op (plus (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; ((_ (char #\-)))
                   (result #'-))
                 (result #'identity)))           
       (n (nat)))
    (result (funcall op n))))
</pre>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">


<p>
The many combinators parse sequences of items. Now we consider a slightly more
general pattern of repetition, in which separators between the items are involved.
Consider the problem of parsing a non-empty list of integers, such as [1,-42,17].
Such a parser can be defined in terms of the many combinator as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">ints :: Parser [Int]
ints = [n:ns | _ &lt;- char ’[’, 
               n &lt;- int , 
               ns &lt;- many [x | _ &lt;- char ’,’, x &lt;- int], 
               _ &lt;- char ’]’]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun ints () 
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; 
      ((_ (char #\[))
       (n (int))
       (ns (many (mlet* &lt;parser&gt;
                     ((_ (char #\,))
                      (x (int)))
                   (result x))))
       (_ (char #\])))
    (result (cons n ns))))    
</pre>



<pre class="example">(assert (equal (funcall (ints) "[1,234,567]")
               '(((1 234 567) . ""))))
</pre>


<p>
As was the case in the previous section for the word parser, we can imagine a
number of other parsers with a similar structure to ints, so it is useful to abstract
on the pattern of repetition and define a general purpose combinator, which we
call sepby1. The combinator <b>sepby1</b> is like <b>many1</b> in that it recognises non-empty
sequences of a given parser p, but different in that the instances of p are separated
by a parser sep whose result values are ignored:
</p>



<pre class="example">sepby1:: Parser a -&gt; Parser b -&gt; Parser [a]
p ‘sepby1‘ sep = [x:xs | x &lt;- p
                       , xs &lt;- many [y | _ &lt;- sep
                                       , y &lt;- p]]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun sepby1 (parser sep)
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt;
     ((x parser)
      (xs (many (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; 
                 ((_ sep) 
                  (y parser))
                 (result y)))))
     (result (cons x xs))))
</pre>


<p>
Note that the fact that the results of the sep parser are ignored is
reflected in the type of the sepby1 combinator: the sep parser gives
results of type b, but this type does not occur in the type [a] of the
results of the combinator.  Now ints can be defined in a more compact
form:
</p>



<pre class="example">ints = [ns | _ &lt;- char ’[’ 
           , ns &lt;- int ‘sepby1‘ char ’,’ 
           , _ &lt;- char ’]’]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun ints ()
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; 
      ((_ (char #\[))
       (ns (sepby1 (int) (char #\,)))
       (_ (char #\])))
    (result ns)))

</pre>


<p>
In fact we can go a little further. The bracketing of parsers by other parsers whose
results are ignored — in the case above, the bracketing parsers are char ’[’ and
char ’]’ — is common enough to also merit its own combinator:
</p>



<pre class="example">bracket :: Parser a -&gt; Parser b -&gt; Parser c -&gt; Parser b
bracket open p close = [x | _ &lt;- open, x &lt;- p, _ &lt;- close]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun bracket (open-parser parser close-parser)
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt;
      ((_ open-parser)
       (x parser)
       (_ close-parser))
    (result x)))
</pre>


<p>
Now ints can be defined just as
</p>



<pre class="example">ints = bracket (char ’[’) (int ‘sepby1‘ char ’,’) (char ’]’ )
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun ints () 
  (bracket (char #\[) (sepby1 (int) (char #\,)) (char #\])))  
</pre>



<p>
Finally, while many1 was defined in terms of many, the combinator sepby (for
possibly-empty sequences) is naturally defined in terms of sepby1:
</p>




<pre class="example">sepby :: Parser a -&gt; Parser b -&gt; Parser [a]
p ‘sepby‘ sep = (p ‘sepby1‘ sep) ++ [[]]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun sepby (parser sep)
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; ()
    (plus (sepby1 parser sep) 
          (result nil))))
</pre>

<h3 id="sec-4-3"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Repetition with meaningful separators</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">


<p>
The sepby combinators handle the case of parsing sequences of items
separated by text that can be ignored. In this final section on
repetition, we address the more general case in which the separators
themselves carry meaning. The combinators defined in this section are
due to Fokker (1995).
</p>
<p>
Consider the problem of parsing simple arithmetic expressions such as
1+2-(3+4), built up from natural numbers using addition, subtraction,
and parentheses. The two arithmetic operators are assumed to associate
to the left (thus, for example, 1-2-3 should be parsed as (1-2)-3),
and have the same precedence. The standard BNF grammar for such
expressions is written as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">expr  ::= expr addop factor | factor
addop ::= + | -
factor ::= + | nat | ( expr ) 
</pre>


<p>
This grammar can be translated directly into a combinator parser:
</p>



<pre class="example">expr :: Parser Int
addop :: Parser (Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int)
factor :: Parser Int
expr = [f x y | x &lt;- expr, f &lt;- addop, y &lt;- factor] ++ factor

addop = [(+) | _ &lt;- char ’+’] ++ [(-) | _ &lt;- char ’-’]

factor = nat ++ bracket (char ’(’) expr (char ’)’)
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun expr ()
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; ()
    (plus  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt;
               ((x (expr))
                (f (addop))
                (y (factor)))
             (result (funcall f x y)))
           (factor))))
</pre>



<pre class="example">    (defun addop ()
      (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; ()
        (plus (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; ((_ (char #\+)))
                (result #'+))
              (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; ((_ (char #\-)))
                (result #'-)))))


(defun factor ()
  (mlet* &lt;parser&gt; () (plus (nat) (bracket (char #\() (expr) (char #\))))))

</pre>


<p>
In fact, rather than just returning some kind of parse tree, the expr parser above
actually evaluates arithmetic expressions to their integer value: the addop parser
returns a function as its result value, which is used to combine the result values
produced by parsing the arguments to the operator.
</p>
<p>
Of course, however, there is a problem with the expr parser as defined
above.  The fact that the operators associate to the left is taken
account of by expr being left-recursive (the first thing it does is
make a recursive call to itself). Thus expr never makes any progress,
and hence does not terminate.
</p>
<p>
As is well-known, this kind of non-termination for parsers can be
solved by replacing left-recursion by iteration. Looking at the expr
grammar, we see that an expression is a sequence of factor s,
separated by addops. Thus the parser for expressions can be re-defined
using many as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">expr = [... | x &lt;- factor
            , fys &lt;- many [(f,y) | f &lt;- addop, y &lt;- factor]]
</pre>


<p>
This takes care of the non-termination, but it still remains to fill in the “&hellip;” part
of the new definition, which computes the value of an expression.
</p>
<p>
Suppose now that the input string is "1-2+3-4". Then after parsing using expr,
the variable x will be 1 and fys will be the list [((-),2), ((+),3), ((-),4)].
These can be reduced to a single value 1-2+3-4 = ((1-2)+3)-4 = -2 by folding:
the built-in function foldl is such that, for example, foldl g a [b,c,d,e] =
((a ‘g‘ b) ‘g‘ c) ‘g‘ d) ‘g‘ e. In the present case, we need to take g as the
function \x (f,y) -&gt; f x y, and a as the integer x:
</p>
<p>
expr = [foldl (\x (f,y) -&gt; f x y) x fys | x &lt;- factor
                                        , fys &lt;- many [(f,y) | f &lt;- addop, y &lt;- factor]]
</p>

<p>
Now, for example, applying expr to the input string "1+2-(3+4)" gives the result
[(-4,""), (3,"-(3+4)", (1,"+2-(3+4)")], as expected.
Playing the generalisation game once again, we can abstract on the pattern of
repetition in expr and define a new combinator. The combinator, chainl1, parses
non-empty sequences of items separated by operators that associate to the left:
</p>



<pre class="example">chainl1 :: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; Parser a
p ‘chainl1‘ op = [foldl (\x (f,y) -&gt; f x y) x fys
                  | x &lt;- p , fys &lt;- many [(f,y) | f &lt;- op, y &lt;- p]]
</pre>


<p>
Thus our parser for expressions can now be written as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">expr = factor ‘chainl1‘ addop

addop = [(+) | _ &lt;- char ’+’] ++ [(-) | _ &lt;- char ’-’]
factor = nat ++ bracket (char ’(’) expr (char ’)’)
</pre>


<p>
Most operator parsers will have a similar structure to addop above, so it is useful
to abstract a combinator for building such parsers:
</p>



<pre class="example">ops:: [(Parser a, b)] -&gt; Parser b
ops xs = foldr1 (++) [[op | _ &lt;- p] | (p,op) &lt;- xs]
</pre>


<p>
The built-in function foldr1 is such that, for example, foldr1 g [a,b,c,d] = a
‘g‘ (b ‘g‘ (c ‘g‘ d)). It is defined for any non-empty list. In the above case
then, foldr1 places the choice operator (++) between each parser in the list. Using
ops, our addop parser can now be defined by
</p>



<pre class="example">addop = ops [(char ’+’, (+)), (char ’-’, (-))]
</pre>


<p>
A possible inefficiency in the definition of the chainl1 combinator is the construction of the intermediate list fys. This can be avoided by giving a direct recursive definition of chainl1 that does not make use of foldl and many, using an
accumulating parameter to construct the final result:
</p>



<pre class="example">chainl1 :: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; Parser a
p ‘chainl1‘ op = p ‘bind‘ rest
where
rest x = (op ‘bind‘ \f -&gt;
p ‘bind‘ \y -&gt;
rest (f x y)) ++ [x]

</pre>

<p>
This definition has a natural operational reading. The parser p ‘chainl1‘ op first
parses a single p, whose result value becomes the initial accumulator for the rest
function. Then it attempts to parse an operator and a single p. If successful, the
accumulator and the result from p are combined using the function f returned from
parsing the operator, and the resulting value becomes the new accumulator when
parsing the remainder of the sequence (using a recursive call to rest). Otherwise,
the sequence is finished, and the accumulator is returned.
</p>
<p>
As another interesting application of chainl1, we can redefine our earlier parser
nat for natural numbers such that it does not construct an intermediate list of
digits. In this case, the op parser does not do any parsing, but returns the function
that combines a natural and a digit:
</p>



<pre class="example">nat :: Parser Int
nat = [ord x - ord ’0’ | x &lt;- digit] ‘chainl1‘ [op]
where
m ‘op‘ n = 10*m + n
</pre>


<p>
Naturally, we can also define a combinator chainr1 that parses non-empty sequences of items separated by operators that associate to the right, rather than to
the left. For simplicity, we only give the direct recursive definition:
</p>



<pre class="example">chainr1 :: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; Parser a
p ‘chainr1‘ op =
p ‘bind‘ \x -&gt;
[f x y | f &lt;- op, y &lt;- p ‘chainr1‘ op] ++ [x]
</pre>


<p>
That is, p ‘chainr1‘ op first parses a single p. Then it attempts to
parse an operator and the rest of the sequence (using a recursive call
to chainr1). If successful,
</p>
<p>
the pair of results from the first p and the rest of the sequence are combined using the function f returned from parsing the operator. Otherwise, the sequence is
finished, and the result from p is returned.
</p>
<p>
As an example of using chainr1, we extend our parser for arithmetic expressions
to handle exponentiation; this operator has higher precedence than the previous
two operators, and associates to the right:
</p>



<pre class="example">expr

= term

‘chainl1‘ addop

term

= factor ‘chainr1‘ expop

factor = nat ++ bracket (char ’(’) expr (char ’)’)
addop

= ops [(char ’+’, (+)), (char ’-’, (-))]

expop

= ops [(char ’^’, (^))]

</pre>


<p>
For completeness, we also define combinators chainl and chainr that have the
same behaviour as chainl1 and chainr1, except that they can also consume no
input, in which case a given value v is returned as the result:
</p>



<pre class="example">chainl :: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; Parser a
chainl p op v = (p ‘chainl1‘ op) ++ [v]
chainr :: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; Parser a
chainr p op v = (p ‘chainr1‘ op) ++ [v]
</pre>


<p>
In summary then, chainl and chainr provide a simple way to build
parsers for expression-like grammars. Using these combinators avoids
the need for transformations to remove left-recursion in the grammar,
that would otherwise result in non-termination of the parser. They
also avoid the need for left-factorisation of the grammar, that would
otherwise result in unnecessary backtracking; we will return to this
point in the next section.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
Using combinators is a simple and flexible method of building
parsers. However, the power of the combinators — in particular, their
ability to backtrack and return multiple results — can lead to parsers
with unexpected space and time performance if one does not take
care. In this section we outline some simple techniques that can be
used to improve the efficiency of parsers. Readers interested in further
techniques are referred to R¨jemo’s thesis (1995), which contains a
chapter on the use of heap o profiling tools in the optimisation of
parser combinators.

<h3 id="sec-5-1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Left factoring</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">


<p>
Consider the simple problem of parsing and evaluating two natural
numbers separated by the addition symbol ‘+’, or by the subtraction
symbol ‘-’. This specification can be translated directly into the
following parser: 
</p>



<pre class="example">eval :: Parser 

eval = add ++

where
add
sub

Int
sub
= [x+y | x &lt;- nat, _ &lt;- char ’+’, y &lt;- nat]
= [x-y | x &lt;- nat, _ &lt;- char ’-’, y &lt;- nat]

</pre>


<p>
This parser gives the correct results, but is inefficient. For example, when parsing
the string "123-456" the number 123 will first be parsed by the add parser, that
will then fail because there is no ‘+’ symbol following the number. The correct parse
will only be found by backtracking in the input string, and parsing the number 123
again, this time from within the sub parser.
Of course, the way to avoid the possibility of backtracking and repeated parsing
is to left factorise the eval parser. That is, the initial use of nat in the component
parsers add and sub should be factorised out:
</p>



<pre class="example">eval = [v | x &lt;- nat, v &lt;- add x ++ sub x]
where
add x = [x+y | _ &lt;- char ’+’, y &lt;- nat]
sub x = [x+y | _ &lt;- char ’-’, y &lt;- nat]
</pre>


<p>
This new version of eval gives the same results as the original
version, but requires no backtracking. Using the new eval, the string
"123-456" can now be parsed in linear time. In fact we can go a little
further, and right factorise the remaining use of nat in both add and
sub. This does not improve the efficiency of eval, but arguably gives a
cleaner parser:
</p>



<pre class="example">eval = [f x y | x &lt;- nat
, f &lt;- ops [(char ’+’, (+)), (char ’-’, (-))]
, y &lt;- nat]
</pre>


<p>
In practice, most cases where left factorisation of a parser is necessary to improve
efficiency will concern parsers for some kind of expression. In such cases, manually
factorising the parser will not be required, since expression-like parsers can be built
using the chain combinators from the previous section, which already encapsulate
the necessary left factorisation.
The motto of this section is the following: backtracking is a powerful tool, but it
should not be used as a substitute for care in designing parsers.

<h3 id="sec-5-2"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Improving laziness</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">


<p>
Recall the definition of the repetition combinator many:
</p>


<pre class="example">many :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many p = [x:xs | x &lt;- p, xs &lt;- many p] ++ [[]]
</pre>


<p>
For example, applying many (char ’a’) to the input "aaab" gives the result
[("aaa","b"), ("aa","ab"), ("a","aab"),("","aaab")]. 
</p>
<p>
Since Gofer is lazy, we would expect the a’s in the first result "aaa"
to become available one at a time, as they are consumed from the
input. This is not in fact what happens. In practice no part of the
result "aaa" will be produced until all the a’s have been consumed.
In other words, many is not as lazy as we would expect.
</p>
<p>
But does this really matter? Yes, because it is common in functional
programming to rely on laziness to avoid the creation of large
intermediate structures (Hughes, 1989). As noted by Wadler (1985;
1992b), what is needed to solve the problem with many is a means to
make explicit that the parser many p always succeeds. (Even if p
itself always fails, many p will still succeed, with the empty list as
the result value.) This is the purpose of the force combinator:
</p>



<pre class="example">force :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
force p = \inp -&gt; let x = p inp in
(fst (head x), snd (head x)) : tail x
</pre>


<p>
Given a parser p that always succeeds, the parser force p has the same
behaviour as p, except that before any parsing of the input string is
attempted the result of the parser is immediately forced to take on
the form (⊥,⊥):⊥, where ⊥ represents a presently undefined value.
</p>
<p>
Using force, the many combinator can be re-defined as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">many :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many p = force ([x:xs | x &lt;- p, xs &lt;- many p] ++ [[]])
</pre>


<p>
The use of force ensures that many p and all of its recursive calls
return at least one result. The new definition of many now has the
expected behaviour under lazy evaluation. For example, applying many
(char ’a’) to the partially-defined string ’a’:⊥ gives the
partially-defined result (’a’:⊥,⊥):⊥. In contrast, with the old version
of many, the result for this example is the completely undefined value
⊥.
</p>
<p>
Some readers might wonder why force is defined using the following selection
functions, rather than by pattern matching?
</p>



<pre class="example">fst :: (a,b) -&gt; a
snd :: (a,b) -&gt; b

head :: [a] -&gt; a
tail :: [a] -&gt; [a]
</pre>


<p>
The answer is that, depending on the semantics of patterns in the
particular implementation language, a definition of force using
patterns might not have the expected behaviour under lazy evaluation.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-5-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-3"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> Limiting the number of results</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">


<p>
Consider the simple problem of parsing a natural number, or if no such
number is present just returning the number 0 as the default result. A
first approximation to such a parser might be as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">number :: Parser Int
number = nat ++ [0]
</pre>


<p>
However, this does not quite have the required behaviour. For example,
applying number to the input "hello" gives the correct result
[(0,"hello")]. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, applying number to "123" gives the
result [(123,""), (0,"123")], whereas we only really want the single
result [(123,"")].
</p>
<p>
One solution to the above problem is to make use of deterministic parser combinators (see section 7.5) — all parsers built using such combinators are restricted
by construction to producing at most one result. A more general solution, however,
is to retain the flexibility of the non-deterministic combinators, but to provide a
means to make explicit that we are only interested in the first result produced by
certain parsers, such as number. This is the purpose of the first combinator:
</p>



<pre class="example">first :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
first p = \inp -&gt; case p inp of
                    [] -&gt; []
                    (x:xs) -&gt; [x]
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun first (parser)
  (lambda (input)
    (let ((results (funcall parser input)))
       (when results (list (cl:first results))))))
</pre>


<p>
Given a parser p, the parser first p has the same behaviour as p, except that
only the first result (if any) is returned. Using first we can define a deterministic
version (+++) of the standard choice combinator (++) for parsers:
</p>



<pre class="example">(+++) :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a -&gt; Parser a
p +++ q = first (p ++ q)
</pre>



<pre class="example">(defun maybe (parser1 parser2)
  (first (plus &lt;parser&gt; parser1 parser2)))
</pre>


<p>
Replacing (++) by (+++) in number gives the desired behaviour.
As well as being used to ensure the correct behaviour of parsers, using (+++) can
also improve their efficiency. As an example, consider a parser that accepts either
of the strings "yellow" or "orange":
</p>



<pre class="example">colour :: Parser String
colour = p1 ++ p2
where
p1 = string "yellow"
p2 = string "orange"
</pre>


<p>
Recall now the behaviour of the choice combinator (++): it takes a string, applies
both argument parsers to this string, and concatenates the resulting lists. Thus in
the colour example, if p1 is successfully applied then p2 will still be applied to the
same string, even though it is guaranteed to fail. This inefficiency can be avoided
using (+++), which ensures that if p1 succeeds then p2 is never applied:
</p>



<pre class="example">colour = p1 +++ p2
where
p1 = string "yellow"
p2 = string "orange"
</pre>


<p>
More generally, if we know that a parser of the form p ++ q is
deterministic (only ever returns at most one result value), then p +++
q has the same behaviour, but is more efficient: if p succeeds then q
is never applied. In the remainder of this article it will mostly be
the (+++) choice combinator that is used. For reasons of efficiency,
in the combinator libraries that accompany this article, the
repetition combinators from the previous section are defined using
(+++) rather than (++).
</p>
<p>
We conclude this section by asking why first is defined by pattern matching,
rather than by using the selection function 
<b>take :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</b> (where,
for example, take 3 "parsing" = "par"):
</p>
<p>
first p = \inp -&gt; take 1 (p inp)
</p>
<p>
The answer concerns the behaviour under lazy evaluation. To see the problem, let
us unfold the use of take in the above definition:
</p>
<p>
first p = \inp -&gt; case p inp of
[]
-&gt; []
(x:xs) -&gt; x : take 0 xs
</p>
<p>
When the sub-expression take 0 xs is evaluated, it will yield []. However, under
lazy evaluation this computation will be suspended until its value is required. The
eﬀect is that the list xs may be retained in memory for some time, when in fact
it can safely be discarded immediately. This is an example of a space leak . The
definition of first using pattern matching does not suﬀer from this problem.

<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Handling lexical issues</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">


<p>
Traditionally, a string to be parsed is not supplied directly to a parser, but is
first passed through a lexical analysis phase (or lexer) that breaks the string into
a sequence of tokens (Aho et al., 1986). Lexical analysis is a convenient place to
remove white-space (spaces, newlines, and tabs) and comments from the input
string, and to distinguish between identifiers and keywords.
</p>
<p>
Since lexers are just simple parsers, they can be built using parser combinators,
as discussed by Hutton (1992). However, as we shall see in this section, the need
for a separate lexer can often be avoided (even for substantial grammars such as
that for Gofer), with lexical issues being handled within the main parser by using
some special purpose combinators.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1"><span class="section-number-3">6.1</span> White-space, comments, and keywords</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">


<p>
We begin by defining a parser that consumes white-space from the beginning of a
string, with a dummy value () returned as result:
</p>



<pre class="example">spaces :: Parser ()
spaces = [() | _ &lt;- many1 (sat isSpace)]
where
isSpace x =
(x == ’ ’) || (x == ’\n’) || (x == ’\t’)
</pre>


<p>
Similarly, a single-line Gofer comment can be consumed as follows:
</p>



<pre class="example">comment :: Parser ()
comment = [() | _ &lt;- string "--"
, _ &lt;- many (sat (\x -&gt; x /= ’\n’))]
</pre>



<p>
We leave it as an exercise for the reader to define a parser for consuming multi-line
Gofer comments {- &hellip; -}, which can be nested.
</p>
<p>
After consuming white-space, there may still be a comment left to consume from
the input string. Dually, after a comment there may still be white-space. Thus we
are motivated to defined a special parser that repeatedly consumes white-space and
comments until no more remain:
</p>



<pre class="example">junk :: Parser ()
junk = [() | _ &lt;- many (spaces +++ comment)]
</pre>


<p>
Note that while spaces and comment can fail, the junk parser always succeeds. We
define two combinators in terms of junk: parse removes junk before applying a
given parser, and token removes junk after applying a parser:
</p>



<pre class="example">parse :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
parse p = [v | _ &lt;- junk, v &lt;- p]
token :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
token p = [v | v &lt;- p, _ &lt;- junk]
</pre>

<p>
With the aid of these two combinators, parsers can be modified to ignore whitespace and comments. Firstly, parse is applied once to the parser as a whole, ensuring that input to the parser begins at a significant character. And secondly, token
is applied once to all sub-parsers that consume complete tokens, thus ensuring that
the input always remains at a significant character.
</p>
<p>
Examples of parsers for complete tokens are nat and int (for natural numbers
and integers), parsers of the form string xs (for symbols and keywords), and
ident (for identifiers). It is useful to define special versions of these parsers — and
more generally, special versions of any user-defined parsers for complete tokens —
that encapsulate the necessary application of token:
</p>



<pre class="example">natural
natural

:: Parser Int
= token nat

integer
integer

:: Parser Int
= token int

symbol
symbol xs

:: String -&gt; Parser String
= token (string xs)

identifier
:: [String] -&gt; Parser String
identifier ks = token [x | x &lt;- ident, not (elem x ks)]
</pre>


<p>
Note that identifier takes a list of keywords as an argument, where a keyword
is a string that is not permitted as an identifier. For example, in Gofer the strings
“data” and “where” (among others) are keywords. Without the keyword check,
parsers defined in terms of identifier could produce unexpected results, or involve
unnecessary backtracking to construct the correct parse of the input string.

<h3 id="sec-6-2"><span class="section-number-3">6.2</span> A parser for λ-expressions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">


<p>
To illustrate the use of the new combinators given above, let us define a parser for
simple λ-expressions extended with a “let” construct for local definitions. Parsed
expressions will be represented in Gofer as follows:
</p>


<pre class="example">data Expr =

App
Lam

Expr Expr

</p>



<pre class="example">expr

atom

= lam +++ local +++ var +++ paren

lam

= [Lam x e |

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-

symbol "let"

symbol "="
expr
symbol "in"
expr]

variable = identifier ["let","in"]

</pre>


<p>
Note how the expr parser handles white-space and comments by using the symbol
parser in place of string and char. Similarly, the keywords “let” and “in” are
handled by using identifier to define the parser for variables. Finally, note how
applications (f e1 e2 &hellip; en) are parsed in the form (((f e1) e2) &hellip; ) by
using the chainl1 combinator.

<h3 id="sec-6-3"><span class="section-number-3">6.3</span> Factorising the parser monad</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-3">


<p>
Up to this point in the article, combinator parsers have been our only example of
the notion of a monad. In this section we define a number of other monads related
to the parser monad, leading up to a modular reformulation of the parser monad
in terms of two simpler monads (Jones, 1995a). The immediate benefit is that, as
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
25
</p>
<p>
we shall see, the basic parser combinators no longer need to be defined explicitly.
Rather, they arise automatically as a special case of lifting monad operations from
a base monad m to a certain other monad parameterised over m. This also means
that, if we change the nature of parsers by modifying the base monad (for example,
limiting parsers to producing at most one result), new combinators for the modified
monad of parsers are also defined automatically.
</p>
<p>
7.1 The exception monad
</p>
<p>
Before starting to define other monads, it is useful to first focus briefly on the
intuition behind the use of monads in functional programming (Wadler, 1992a).
The basic idea behind monads is to distinguish the values that a computation
can produce from the computation itself. More specifically, given a monad m and
a type a, we can think of m a as the type of computations that yield results of
type a, with the nature of the computation captured by the type constructor m.
The combinators result and bind (with zero and (++) if appropriate) provide a
means to structure the building of such computations:
</p>
<p>
result
bind
zero
(++)
</p>
<p>
::
::
::
::
</p>
<p>
m
m
m
m
</p>
<p>
a
a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
a
a -&gt; m a -&gt; m a
</p>
<p>
From a computational point of view, result converts values into computations
that yield those values; bind chains two computations together in sequence, with
results of the first computation being made available for use in the second; zero is
the trivial computation that does nothing; and finally, (++) is some kind of choice
operation for computations.
</p>
<p>
Consider, for example, the type constructor Maybe:
</p>
<p>
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
</p>
<p>
We can think of a value of type Maybe a as a computation that either succeeds with
a value of type a, or fails, producing no value. Thus, the type constructor Maybe
captures computations that have the possibility to fail.
</p>
<p>
Defining the monad combinators for a given type constructor is usually
just a matter of making the “obvious definitions” suggested by the
types of the combinators. For example, the type constructor Maybe can
be made into a monad with a zero and plus using the following
definitions: 
instance Monad Maybe where &ndash; result :: a -&gt; Maybe a
result x = Just x
&ndash; bind :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
(Just x) ‘bind‘ f = f x
Nothing ‘bind‘ f = Nothing
</p>

<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
</p>
<p>
instance Monad0Plus Maybe where
&ndash; zero
:: Maybe a
zero
= Nothing
&ndash; (++)
Just x ++ y
Nothing ++ y
</p>
<p>
:: Maybe a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe a
= Just x
= y
</p>
<p>
That is, result converts a value into a computation that succeeds with this value;
bind is a sequencing operator, with a successful result from the first computation
being available for use in the second computation; zero is the computation that
fails; and finally, (++) is a (deterministic) choice operator that returns the first
computation if it succeeds, and the second otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Since failure can be viewed as a simple kind of exception, Maybe is sometimes
called the exception monad in the literature (Spivey, 1990).
</p>
<p>
7.2 The non-determinism monad
</p>
<p>
A natural generalisation of Maybe is the list type constructor []. While a value of
type Maybe a can be thought of as a computation that either succeeds with a single
result of type a or fails, a value of type [a] can be thought of as a computation
that has the possibility to succeed with any number of results of type a, including
zero (which represents failure). Thus the list type constructor [] can be used to
capture non-deterministic computations.
</p>
<p>
Now [] can be made into a monad with a zero and plus:
</p>
<p>
instance Monad [] where
&ndash; result
:: a -&gt; [a]
result x
= [x]
&ndash; bind
:: [a] -&gt; (a -&gt; [b]) -&gt; [b]
[]
‘bind‘ f = []
(x:xs) ‘bind‘ f = f x ++ (xs ‘bind‘ f)
instance Monad0Plus [] where
&ndash; zero
:: [a]
zero
= []
&ndash; (++)
[]
++ ys
(x:xs) ++ ys
</p>
<p>
:: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
= ys
= x : (xs ++ ys)
</p>
<p>
That is, result converts a value into a computation that succeeds with this single
value; bind is a sequencing operator for non-deterministic computations; zero always fails; and finally, (++) is a (non-deterministic) choice operator that appends
the results of the two argument computations.
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
27
</p>
<p>
7.3 The state-transformer monad
</p>
<p>
Consider the (binary) type constructor State:
type State s a = s -&gt; (a,s)
</p>
<p>
Values of type State s a can be interpreted as follows: they are computations that
take an initial state of type s, and yield a value of type a together with a new state
of type s. Thus, the type constructor State s obtained by applying State to a
single type s captures computations that involve state of type s. We will refer to
values of type State s a as stateful computations.
</p>
<p>
Now State s can be made into a monad:
instance Monad (State s) where
&ndash; result :: a -&gt; State s a
result v
= \s -&gt; (v,s)
&ndash; bind
:: State s a -&gt; (a -&gt; State s b) -&gt; State s b
st ‘bind‘ f = \s -&gt; let (v,s’) = st s in f v s’
</p>
<p>
That is, result converts a value into a stateful computation that returns that value
without modifying the internal state, and bind composes two stateful computations
in sequence, with the result value from the first being supplied as input to the
second. Thinking pictorially in terms of boxes and wires is a useful aid to becoming
familiar with these two operations (Jones &amp; Launchbury, 1994).
</p>
<p>
The state-transformer monad State s does not have a zero and a plus. However,
as we shall see in the next section, the parameterised state-transformer monad over
a given based monad m does have a zero and a plus, provided that m does.
</p>
<p>
To allow us to access and modify the internal state, a few extra operations on
the monad State s are introduced. The first operation, update, modifies the state
by applying a given function, and returns the old state as the result value of the
computation. The remaining two operations are defined in terms of update: set
replaces the state with a new state, and returns the old state as the result; fetch
returns the state without modifying it.
</p>
<p>
update
set
fetch
</p>
<p>
:: (s -&gt; s) -&gt; State s s
:: s -&gt; State s s
:: State s s
</p>
<p>
update f = \s -&gt; (s, f s)
set s
= update (_ -&gt; s)
fetch
= update id
</p>
<p>
In fact State s is not the only monad for which it makes sense to define these
operations. For this reason we encapsulate the extra operations in a class, so that
the same names can be used for the operations of diﬀerent monads:
</p>
<p>
class Monad m =&gt; StateMonad m s where
update :: (s -&gt; s) -&gt; m s
</p>
<p>
28
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
set
fetch
set s
fetch
</p>
<p>
:: s -&gt; m s
:: m s
= update (_ -&gt; s)
= update id
</p>
<p>
This declaration can be read as follows: a type constructor m and a type s are
together a member of the class StateMonad if m is a member of the class Monad,
and if m is also equipped with update, set, and fetch operations of the specified
types. Moreover, the fact that set and fetch can be defined in terms of update is
also reflected in the declaration, by means of default definitions.
</p>
<p>
Now because State s is already a monad, it can be made into a state monad
using the update operation as defined earlier:
</p>
<p>
instance StateMonad (State s) s where
&ndash; update :: (s -&gt; s) -&gt; State s s
update f
= \s -&gt; (s, f s)
</p>
<p>
7.4 The parameterised state-transformer monad
</p>
<p>
Recall now our type of combinator parsers:
type Parser a = String -&gt; [(a,String)]
</p>
<p>
We see now that parsers combine two kinds of computation:
non-deterministic computations (the result of a parser is a list), and
stateful computations (the state is the string being
parsed). Abstracting from the specific case of returning a list of
results, the Parser type gives rise to a generalised version of the
State type constructor that applies a given type constructor m to the
result of the computation: type StateM m s a = s -&gt; m (a,s) Now StateM
m s can be made into a monad with a zero and a plus, by inheriting the
monad operations from the base monad m: 
</p>
<p>
instance Monad m =&gt; Monad (StateM m s) where 
&ndash; result :: a -&gt; StateM m s a
result v

</p>
<p>
That is, result converts a value into a computation that returns this value without
modifying the internal state; bind chains two computations together; zero is the
computation that fails regardless of the input state; and finally, (++) is a choice
operation that passes the same input state through to both of the argument computations, and combines their results.
</p>
<p>
In the previous section we defined the extra operations update, set and fetch
for the monad State s. Of course, these operations can also be defined for the
parameterised state-transformer monad StateM m s. As previously, we only need
to define update, the remaining two operations being defined automatically via
default definitions:
</p>
<p>
instance Monad m =&gt; StateMonad (StateM m s) s where
&ndash; update :: Monad m =&gt; (s -&gt; s) -&gt; StateM m s s
update f
= \s -&gt; result (s, f s)
</p>
<p>
7.5 The parser monad revisited
</p>
<p>
Recall once again our type of combinator parsers:
type Parser a = String -&gt; [(a,String)]
</p>
<p>
This type can now be re-expressed using the parameterised state-transformer monad
StateM m s by taking [] for m, and String for s:
type Parser a = StateM [] String a
</p>
<p>
But why view the Parser type in this way? The answer is that all the basic parser
combinators no longer need to be defined explicitly (except one, the parser item for
single characters), but rather arise as an instance of the general case of extending
monad operations from a type constructor m to the type constructor StateM m s.
More specifically, since [] forms a monad with a zero and a plus, so does State []
String, and hence Gofer automatically provides the following combinators:
result
bind
zero
(++)
</p>
<p>
::
::
::
::
</p>
<p>
a -&gt; Parser a
Parser a -&gt; (a -&gt; Parser b) -&gt; Parser b
Parser a
Parser a -&gt; Parser a -&gt; Parser a
</p>
<p>
Moreover, defining the parser monad in this modular way in terms of StateM
means that, if we change the type of parsers, then new combinators for the modified
type are also defined automatically. For example, consider replacing
type Parser a = StateM [] String a
by a new definition in which the list type constructor [] (which captures nondeterministic computations that can return many results) is replaced by the Maybe
type constructor (which captures deterministic computations that either fail, returning no result, or succeed with a single result):
</p>
<p>
30
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
data Maybe a
</p>
<p>
= Just a | Nothing
</p>
<p>
type Parser a = StateM Maybe String a
</p>
<p>
Since Maybe forms a monad with a zero and a plus, so does the re-defined Parser
type constructor, and hence Gofer automatically provides result, bind, zero, and
(++) combinators for deterministic parsers. In earlier approaches that do not exploit
the monadic nature of parsers (Wadler, 1985; Hutton, 1992; Fokker, 1995), the basic
combinators would have to be re-defined by hand.
</p>
<p>
The only basic parsing primitive that does not arise from the monadic structure
of the Parser type is the parser item for consuming single characters:
item :: Parser Char
item = \inp -&gt; case inp of
[]
-&gt; []
(x:xs) -&gt; [(x,xs)]
However, item can now be re-defined in monadic style. We first fetch the current
state (the input string); if the string is empty then the item parser fails, otherwise
the first character is consumed (by applying the tail function to the state), and
returned as the result value of the parser:
item
</p>
<p>
= [x | (x:_) &lt;- update tail]
</p>
<p>
The advantage of the monadic definition of item is that it does not depend upon
the internal details of the Parser type. Thus, for example, it works equally well for
both the non-deterministic and deterministic versions of Parser.
</p>
<p>
8 Handling the oﬀside rule
</p>
<p>
Earlier (section 6) we showed that the need for a lexer to handle white-space,
comments, and keywords can be avoided by using special combinators within the
main parser. Another task usually performed by a lexer is handling the Gofer oﬀside
rule. This rule allows the grouping of definitions in a program to be indicated
using indentation, and is usually implemented by the lexer inserting extra tokens
(concerning indentation) into its output stream.
</p>
<p>
In this section we show that Gofer’s oﬀside rule can be handled in a simple and
natural manner without a separate lexer, by once again using special combinators.
Our approach was inspired by the monadic view of parsers, and is a development
of an idea described earlier by Hutton (1992).
8.1 The oﬀside rule
Consider the following simple Gofer program:
a = b + c
where
b = 10
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
31
</p>
<p>
c = 15 - 5
d = a * 2
It is clear from the use of indentation that a and d are intended to be global
definitions, with b and c local definitions to a. Indeed, the above program can be
viewed as a shorthand for the following program, in which the grouping of definitions
is made explicit using special brackets and separators:
{ a = b + c
where
{ b = 10
; c = 15 - 5 }
; d = a * 2 }
How the grouping of Gofer definitions follows from their indentation is formally
specified by the oﬀside rule. The essence of the rule is as follows: consecutive definitions that begin in the same column c are deemed to be part of the same group.
To make parsing easier, it is further required that the remainder of the text of each
definition (excluding white-space and comments, of course) in a group must occur
in a column strictly greater than c. In terms of the oﬀside rule then, definitions a
and d in the example program above are formally grouped together (and similarly
for b and c) because they start in the same column as one another.
8.2 Modifying the type of parsers
To implement the oﬀside rule, we will have to maintain some extra information
during parsing. First of all, since column numbers play a crucial role in the oﬀside
rule, parsers will need to know the column number of the first character in their
input string. In fact, it turns out that parsers will also require the current line
number. Thus our present type of combinator parsers,
type Parser a = StateM [] String a
is revised to the following type, in which the internal state of a parser now contains
a (line,column) position in addition to a string:
type Parser a = StateM [] Pstring a
type Pstring
</p>
<p>
= (Pos,String)
</p>
<p>
type Pos
</p>
<p>
= (Int,Int)
</p>
<p>
In addition, parsers will need to know the starting position of the current definition being parsed — if the oﬀside rule is not in eﬀect, this definition position can
be set with a negative column number. Thus our type of parsers is revised once
more, to take the current definition position as an extra argument:
type Parser a = Pos -&gt; StateM [] Pstring a
</p>
<p>
32
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
</p>
<p>
Another option would have been to maintain the definition position in the parser
state, along with the current position and the string to be parsed. However, definition positions can be nested, and supplying the position as an extra argument to
parsers — as opposed to within the parser state — is more natural from the point
of view of implementing nesting of positions.
Is the revised Parser type still a monad? Abstracting from the details, the body
of the Parser type definition is of the form s -&gt; m a (in our case s is Pos, m is the
monad StateM [] Pstring, and a is the parameter type a.) We recognise this as
being similar to the type s -&gt; m (a,s) of parameterised state-transformers, the
diﬀerence being that the type s of states no longer occurs in the type of the result:
in other words, the state can be read, but not modified. Thus we can think of s -&gt;
m a as the type of parameterised state-readers. The monadic nature of this type is
the topic of the next section.
8.3 The parameterised state-reader monad
Consider the type constructor ReaderM, defined as follows:
type ReaderM m s a = s -&gt; m a
In a similar way to StateM m s, ReaderM m s can be made into a monad with a
zero and a plus, by inheriting the monad operations from the base monad m:
instance Monad m =&gt; Monad (ReaderM m s) where
&ndash; result
:: a -&gt; ReaderM m s a
result v
= \s -&gt; result v
&ndash; bind
:: ReaderM m s a -&gt;
-(a -&gt; ReaderM m s b) -&gt; ReaderM m s b
srm ‘bind‘ f = \s -&gt; srm s ‘bind‘ \v -&gt; f v s
instance Monad0Plus m =&gt; Monad0Plus (ReaderM m s) where
&ndash; zero
:: ReaderM m s a
zero
= \s -&gt; zero
&ndash; (++)
:: ReaderM m s a -&gt;
-ReaderM m s a -&gt; ReaderM m s a
srm ++ srm’ = \s -&gt; srm s ++ srm’ s
That is, result converts a value into a computation that returns this value without
consulting the state; bind chains two computations together, with the same state
being passed to both computations (contrast with the bind operation for StateM,
in which the second computation receives the new state produced by the first computation); zero is the computation that fails; and finally, (++) is a choice operation
that passes the same state to both of the argument computations.
To allow us to access and set the state, a couple of extra operations on the
parameterised state-reader monad ReaderM m s are introduced. As for StateM, we
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
33
</p>
<p>
encapsulate the extra operations in a class. The operation env returns the state as
the result of the computation, while setenv replaces the current state for a given
computation with a new state:
class Monad m =&gt; ReaderMonad m s where
env
:: m s
setenv :: s -&gt; m a -&gt; m a
instance Monad m =&gt; ReaderMonad (ReaderM m s) s where
&ndash; env
:: Monad m =&gt; ReaderM m s s
env
= \s -&gt; result s
&ndash; setenv
:: Monad m =&gt; s -&gt;
-ReaderM m s a -&gt; ReaderM m s a
setenv s srm = _ -&gt; srm s
The name env comes from the fact that one can think of the state supplied to a
state-reader as being a kind of env ironment. Indeed, in the literature state-reader
monads are sometimes called environment monads.
8.4 The new parser combinators
Using the ReaderM type constructor, our revised type of parsers
type Parser a = Pos -&gt; StateM [] Pstring a
can now be expressed as follows:
type Parser a = ReaderM (StateM [] Pstring) Pos a
Now since [] forms a monad with a zero and a plus, so does StateM [] Pstring,
and hence so does ReaderM (StateM [] Pstring) Pos. Thus Gofer automatically
provides result, bind, zero, and (++) operations for parsers that can handle the
oﬀside rule. Since the type of parsers is now defined in terms of ReaderM at the top
level, the extra operations env and setenv are also provided for parsers. Moreover,
the extra operation update (and the derived operations set and fetch) from the
underlying state monad can be lifted to the new type of parsers — or more generally,
to any parameterised state-reader monad — by ignoring the environment:
instance StateMonad m a =&gt; StateMonad (ReaderM m s) a where
&ndash; update :: StateMonad m a =&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; ReaderM m s a
update f
= _ -&gt; update f
Now that the internal state of parsers has been modified (from String to Pstring),
the parser item for consuming single characters from the input must also be modified. The new definition for item is similar to the old,
item :: Parser Char
item = [x | (x:_) &lt;- update tail]
</p>
<p>
34
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
</p>
<p>
except that the item parser now fails if the position of the character to be consumed
is not onside with respect to current definition position:
item :: Parser Char
item = [x | (pos,x:_) &lt;- update newstate
, defpos
&lt;- env
, onside pos defpos]
A position is onside if its column number is strictly greater than the current definition column. However, the first character of a new definition begins in the same
column as the definition column, so this is handled as a special case:
onside
:: Pos -&gt; Pos -&gt; Bool
onside (l,c) (dl,dc) = (c &gt; dc) || (l == dl)
The remaining auxiliary function, newstate, consumes the first character from the
input string, and updates the current position accordingly (for example, if a newline
character was consumed, the current line number is incremented, and the current
column number is set back to zero):
newstate :: Pstring -&gt; Pstring
newstate ((l,c),x:xs)
= (newpos,xs)
where
newpos = case x of
’\n’ -&gt; (l+1,0)
’\t’ -&gt; (l,((c ‘div‘ 8)+1)*8)
_
-&gt; (l,c+1)
One aspect of the oﬀside rule still remains to be addressed: for the purposes
of this rule, white-space and comments are not significant, and should always be
successfully consumed even if they contain characters that are not onside. This can
be handled by temporarily setting the definition position to (0, −1) within the junk
parser for white-space and comments:
junk :: Parser ()
junk = [() | _ &lt;- setenv (0,-1) (many (spaces +++ comment))]
All that remains now is to define a combinator that parses a sequence of definitions subject to the Gofer oﬀside rule:
many1<sub>offside</sub> :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many1<sub>offside</sub> p = [vs | (pos,_) &lt;- fetch
, vs
&lt;- setenv pos (many1 (off p))]
That is, many1 offside p behaves just as many1 (off p), except that within this
parser the definition position is set to the current position. (There is no need to
skip white-space and comments before setting the position, since this will already
have been eﬀected by proper use of the lexical combinators token and parse.) The
auxiliary combinator off takes care of setting the definition position locally for
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
35
</p>
<p>
each new definition in the sequence, where a new definition begins if the column
position equals the definition column position:
off :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
off p = [v | (dl,dc)
&lt;- env
, ((l,c),_) &lt;- fetch
, c == dc
, v
&lt;- setenv (l,dc) p]
For completeness, we also define a combinator many offside that has the same
behaviour as the combinator many1 offside, except that it can also parse an empty
sequence of definitions:
many<sub>offside</sub> :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many<sub>offside</sub> p = many1<sub>offside</sub> p +++ [[]]
To illustrate the use of the new combinators defined above, let us modify our
parser for λ-expressions (section 6.2) so that the “let” construct permits nonempty sequences of local definitions subject to the oﬀside rule. The datatype Expr of
expressions is first modified so that the Let constructor has type [(String,Expr)]
-&gt; Expr instead of String -&gt; Expr -&gt; Expr:
data Expr = &hellip;
</p><table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left">Let [(String,Expr)] Expr</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">&hellip;</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The only part of the parser that needs to be modified is the parser local for local
definitions, which now accepts sequences:
local = [Let ds e |
,
,
,
defn

<p>
_
ds
_
e
</p>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-
</p>
<p>
symbol "let"
many1<sub>offside</sub> defn
symbol "in"
expr]
</p>
<p>
= [(x,e) | x &lt;- identifier
, _ &lt;- symbol "="
, e &lt;- expr]
</p>
<p>
We conclude this section by noting that the use of the oﬀside rule when laying out
sequences of Gofer definitions is not mandatory. As shown in our initial example, one
also has the option to include explicit layout information in the form of parentheses
“{” and “}” around the sequence, with definitions separated by semi-colons “;”.
We leave it as an exercise to the reader to use many offside to define a combinator
that implements this convention.
In summary then, to permit combinator parsers to handle the Gofer oﬀside rule,
we changed the type of parsers to include some positional information, modified
the item and junk combinators accordingly, and defined two new combinators:
many1 offside and many offside. All other necessary redefining of combinators
is done automatically by the Gofer type system.

10 Appendix: a parser for data definitions
To illustrate the monadic parser combinators developed in this article in a real-life
setting, we consider the problem of parsing a sequence of Gofer datatype definitions.
An example of such a sequence is as follows:
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
data Tree a b = Leaf a
</p><table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left">Node (Tree a b, b, Tree a b)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Within the parser, datatypes will be represented as follows:
type Data = (String,
[String],
[(String,[Type])])

<p>
&ndash; type name
&ndash; parameters
&ndash; constructors and arguments
</p>
<p>
The representation Type for types will be treated shortly. A parser datadecls ::

</p>

,
,
,
,
</p>
<p>
_
x
xs
_
b
</p>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-
</p>
<p>
symbol "data"
constructor
many variable
symbol "="
condecl ‘sepby1‘ symbol "|"]
</p>
<p>
constructor = token [(x:xs) | x &lt;- upper
, xs &lt;- many alphanum]

</p>
<p>
= identifier ["data"]
</p>
<p>
condecl
</p>
<p>
= [(x,ts) | x &lt;- constructor
, ts &lt;- many type2]
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of points worth noting about this parser. Firstly, all lexical
issues (white-space and comments, the oﬀside rule, and keywords) are handled by
combinators. And secondly, since constructor is a parser for a complete token, the
token combinator is applied within its definition.

where f [t] = t
f ts = Tuple ts
</p>
<p>
Note how chainr1 and chainl1 are used to handle parsing of function-types and
application. Note also that (as in Gofer) building a singleton tuple (t) of a type t
is not possible, since (t) is treated as a parenthesised expression.

sat produced by parsing the arguments to the operator.
</p>
<p>
Of course, however, there is a problem with the expr parser as defined above.
The fact that the operators associate to the left is taken account of by expr being
left-recursive (the first thing it does is make a recursive call to itself). Thus expr
never makes any progress, and hence does not terminate.
</p>
<p>
As is well-known, this kind of non-termination for parsers can be solved by replacing left-recursion by iteration. Looking at the expr grammar, we see that an
expression is a sequence of factor s, separated by addops. Thus the parser for expressions can be re-defined using many as follows:
expr = [&hellip; | x
&lt;- factor
, fys &lt;- many [(f,y) | f &lt;- addop, y &lt;- factor]]
</p>
<p>
This takes care of the non-termination, but it still remains to fill in the “&hellip;” part
of the new definition, which computes the value of an expression.
Suppose now that the input string is "1-2+3-4". Then after parsing using expr,
the variable x will be 1 and fys will be the list [((-),2), ((+),3), ((-),4)].
These can be reduced to a single value 1-2+3-4 = ((1-2)+3)-4 = -2 by folding:
the built-in function foldl is such that, for example, foldl g a [b,c,d,e] =
((a ‘g‘ b) ‘g‘ c) ‘g‘ d) ‘g‘ e. In the present case, we need to take g as the
function \x (f,y) -&gt; f x y, and a as the integer x:
expr = [foldl (\x (f,y) -&gt; f x y) x fys
</p><table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left">x</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

&lt;- factor
, fys &lt;- many [(f,y) | f &lt;- addop, y &lt;- factor]]
Now, for example, applying expr to the input string "1+2-(3+4)" gives the result
[(-4,""), (3,"-(3+4)", (1,"+2-(3+4)")], as expected.
Playing the generalisation game once again, we can abstract on the pattern of
repetition in expr and define a new combinator. The combinator, chainl1, parses
non-empty sequences of items separated by operators that associate to the left:
chainl1
:: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; Parser a
p ‘chainl1‘ op = [foldl (\x (f,y) -&gt; f x y) x fys
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left">x</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

&lt;- p
, fys &lt;- many [(f,y) | f &lt;- op, y &lt;- p]]
Thus our parser for expressions can now be written as follows:
expr

<p>
= factor ‘chainl1‘ addop
</p>
<p>
addop
</p>
<p>
= [(<del>) | _ &lt;- char ’+’] +</del> [(-) | _ &lt;- char ’-’]
</p>
<p>
factor = nat ++ bracket (char ’(’) expr (char ’)’)
Most operator parsers will have a similar structure to addop above, so it is useful
to abstract a combinator for building such parsers:
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
17
</p>
<p>
ops
:: [(Parser a, b)] -&gt; Parser b
ops xs = foldr1 (++) [[op | _ &lt;- p] | (p,op) &lt;- xs]
The built-in function foldr1 is such that, for example, foldr1 g [a,b,c,d] = a
‘g‘ (b ‘g‘ (c ‘g‘ d)). It is defined for any non-empty list. In the above case
then, foldr1 places the choice operator (++) between each parser in the list. Using
ops, our addop parser can now be defined by
addop = ops [(char ’+’, (+)), (char ’-’, (-))]
A possible inefficiency in the definition of the chainl1 combinator is the construction of the intermediate list fys. This can be avoided by giving a direct recursive definition of chainl1 that does not make use of foldl and many, using an
accumulating parameter to construct the final result:
chainl1
:: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; Parser a
p ‘chainl1‘ op = p ‘bind‘ rest
where
rest x = (op ‘bind‘ \f -&gt;
p ‘bind‘ \y -&gt;
rest (f x y)) ++ [x]
This definition has a natural operational reading. The parser p ‘chainl1‘ op first
parses a single p, whose result value becomes the initial accumulator for the rest
function. Then it attempts to parse an operator and a single p. If successful, the
accumulator and the result from p are combined using the function f returned from
parsing the operator, and the resulting value becomes the new accumulator when
parsing the remainder of the sequence (using a recursive call to rest). Otherwise,
the sequence is finished, and the accumulator is returned.
As another interesting application of chainl1, we can redefine our earlier parser
nat for natural numbers such that it does not construct an intermediate list of
digits. In this case, the op parser does not do any parsing, but returns the function
that combines a natural and a digit:
nat :: Parser Int
nat = [ord x - ord ’0’ | x &lt;- digit] ‘chainl1‘ [op]
where
m ‘op‘ n = 10*m + n
Naturally, we can also define a combinator chainr1 that parses non-empty sequences of items separated by operators that associate to the right, rather than to
the left. For simplicity, we only give the direct recursive definition:
chainr1
:: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; Parser a
p ‘chainr1‘ op =
p ‘bind‘ \x -&gt;
[f x y | f &lt;- op, y &lt;- p ‘chainr1‘ op] ++ [x]
That is, p ‘chainr1‘ op first parses a single p. Then it attempts to parse an operator and the rest of the sequence (using a recursive call to chainr1). If successful,
</p>
<p>
18
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
</p>
<p>
the pair of results from the first p and the rest of the sequence are combined using the function f returned from parsing the operator. Otherwise, the sequence is
finished, and the result from p is returned.
As an example of using chainr1, we extend our parser for arithmetic expressions
to handle exponentiation; this operator has higher precedence than the previous
two operators, and associates to the right:
expr
</p>
<p>
= term
</p>
<p>
‘chainl1‘ addop
</p>
<p>
term
</p>
<p>
= factor ‘chainr1‘ expop
</p>
<p>
factor = nat ++ bracket (char ’(’) expr (char ’)’)
addop
</p>
<p>
= ops [(char ’+’, (+)), (char ’-’, (-))]
</p>
<p>
expop
</p>
<p>
= ops [(char ’<sup>’</sup>, (^))]
</p>
<p>
For completeness, we also define combinators chainl and chainr that have the
same behaviour as chainl1 and chainr1, except that they can also consume no
input, in which case a given value v is returned as the result:
chainl :: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; Parser a
chainl p op v = (p ‘chainl1‘ op) ++ [v]
chainr :: Parser a -&gt; Parser (a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; Parser a
chainr p op v = (p ‘chainr1‘ op) ++ [v]
In summary then, chainl and chainr provide a simple way to build parsers for
expression-like grammars. Using these combinators avoids the need for transformations to remove left-recursion in the grammar, that would otherwise result in
non-termination of the parser. They also avoid the need for left-factorisation of the
grammar, that would otherwise result in unnecessary backtracking; we will return
to this point in the next section.

5 Efficiency of parsers
Using combinators is a simple and flexible method of building parsers. However,
the power of the combinators — in particular, their ability to backtrack and return
multiple results — can lead to parsers with unexpected space and time performance
if one does not take care. In this section we outline some simple techniques that can
be used to improve the efficiency of parsers. Readers interested in further techniques
are referred to R¨jemo’s thesis (1995), which contains a chapter on the use of heap
o
profiling tools in the optimisation of parser combinators.

5.1 Left factoring
Consider the simple problem of parsing and evaluating two natural numbers separated by the addition symbol ‘+’, or by the subtraction symbol ‘-’. This specification
can be translated directly into the following parser:
eval :: Parser
eval = add ++
where
add
sub
</p>
<p>
Int
sub
= [x+y | x &lt;- nat, _ &lt;- char ’+’, y &lt;- nat]
= [x-y | x &lt;- nat, _ &lt;- char ’-’, y &lt;- nat]
</p>
<p>
This parser gives the correct results, but is inefficient. For example, when parsing
the string "123-456" the number 123 will first be parsed by the add parser, that
will then fail because there is no ‘+’ symbol following the number. The correct parse
will only be found by backtracking in the input string, and parsing the number 123
again, this time from within the sub parser.
Of course, the way to avoid the possibility of backtracking and repeated parsing
is to left factorise the eval parser. That is, the initial use of nat in the component
parsers add and sub should be factorised out:
eval = [v | x &lt;- nat, v &lt;- add x ++ sub x]
where
add x = [x+y | _ &lt;- char ’+’, y &lt;- nat]
sub x = [x+y | _ &lt;- char ’-’, y &lt;- nat]
This new version of eval gives the same results as the original version, but requires
no backtracking. Using the new eval, the string "123-456" can now be parsed in
linear time. In fact we can go a little further, and right factorise the remaining
use of nat in both add and sub. This does not improve the efficiency of eval, but
arguably gives a cleaner parser:
eval = [f x y | x &lt;- nat
, f &lt;- ops [(char ’+’, (+)), (char ’-’, (-))]
, y &lt;- nat]
In practice, most cases where left factorisation of a parser is necessary to improve
efficiency will concern parsers for some kind of expression. In such cases, manually
factorising the parser will not be required, since expression-like parsers can be built
using the chain combinators from the previous section, which already encapsulate
the necessary left factorisation.
The motto of this section is the following: backtracking is a powerful tool, but it
should not be used as a substitute for care in designing parsers.
5.2 Improving laziness
Recall the definition of the repetition combinator many:
many :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many p = [x:xs | x &lt;- p, xs &lt;- many p] ++ [[]]
</p>
<p>
20
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
</p>
<p>
For example, applying many (char ’a’) to the input "aaab" gives the result
[("aaa","b"), ("aa","ab"), ("a","aab"),("","aaab")]. Since Gofer is lazy,
we would expect the a’s in the first result "aaa" to become available one at a time,
as they are consumed from the input. This is not in fact what happens. In practice
no part of the result "aaa" will be produced until all the a’s have been consumed.
In other words, many is not as lazy as we would expect.
But does this really matter? Yes, because it is common in functional programming
to rely on laziness to avoid the creation of large intermediate structures (Hughes,
1989). As noted by Wadler (1985; 1992b), what is needed to solve the problem with
many is a means to make explicit that the parser many p always succeeds. (Even
if p itself always fails, many p will still succeed, with the empty list as the result
value.) This is the purpose of the force combinator:
force :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
force p = \inp -&gt; let x = p inp in
(fst (head x), snd (head x)) : tail x
Given a parser p that always succeeds, the parser force p has the same behaviour
as p, except that before any parsing of the input string is attempted the result of
the parser is immediately forced to take on the form (⊥,⊥):⊥, where ⊥ represents
a presently undefined value.
Using force, the many combinator can be re-defined as follows:
many :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many p = force ([x:xs | x &lt;- p, xs &lt;- many p] ++ [[]])
The use of force ensures that many p and all of its recursive calls return at least
one result. The new definition of many now has the expected behaviour under lazy
evaluation. For example, applying many (char ’a’) to the partially-defined string
’a’:⊥ gives the partially-defined result (’a’:⊥,⊥):⊥. In contrast, with the old
version of many, the result for this example is the completely undefined value ⊥.
Some readers might wonder why force is defined using the following selection
functions, rather than by pattern matching?
fst :: (a,b) -&gt; a
snd :: (a,b) -&gt; b
</p>
<p>
head :: [a] -&gt; a
tail :: [a] -&gt; [a]
</p>
<p>
The answer is that, depending on the semantics of patterns in the particular implementation language, a definition of force using patterns might not have the
expected behaviour under lazy evaluation.
5.3 Limiting the number of results
Consider the simple problem of parsing a natural number, or if no such number is
present just returning the number 0 as the default result. A first approximation to
such a parser might be as follows:
number :: Parser Int
number = nat ++ <sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.1" href="#fn-.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
21
</p>
<p>
However, this does not quite have the required behaviour. For example, applying
number to the input "hello" gives the correct result [(0,"hello")]. On the other
hand, applying number to "123" gives the result [(123,""), (0,"123")], whereas
we only really want the single result [(123,"")].
One solution to the above problem is to make use of deterministic parser combinators (see section 7.5) — all parsers built using such combinators are restricted
by construction to producing at most one result. A more general solution, however,
is to retain the flexibility of the non-deterministic combinators, but to provide a
means to make explicit that we are only interested in the first result produced by
certain parsers, such as number. This is the purpose of the first combinator:
first :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
first p = \inp -&gt; case p inp of
[]
-&gt; []
(x:xs) -&gt; [x]
Given a parser p, the parser first p has the same behaviour as p, except that
only the first result (if any) is returned. Using first we can define a deterministic
version (+++) of the standard choice combinator (++) for parsers:
(+++) :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a -&gt; Parser a
p +++ q = first (p ++ q)
Replacing (++) by (+++) in number gives the desired behaviour.
As well as being used to ensure the correct behaviour of parsers, using (+++) can
also improve their efficiency. As an example, consider a parser that accepts either
of the strings "yellow" or "orange":
colour :: Parser String
colour = p1 ++ p2
where
p1 = string "yellow"
p2 = string "orange"
Recall now the behaviour of the choice combinator (++): it takes a string, applies
both argument parsers to this string, and concatenates the resulting lists. Thus in
the colour example, if p1 is successfully applied then p2 will still be applied to the
same string, even though it is guaranteed to fail. This inefficiency can be avoided
using (+++), which ensures that if p1 succeeds then p2 is never applied:
colour = p1 +++ p2
where
p1 = string "yellow"
p2 = string "orange"
More generally, if we know that a parser of the form p ++ q is deterministic (only
ever returns at most one result value), then p +++ q has the same behaviour, but is
more efficient: if p succeeds then q is never applied. In the remainder of this article
it will mostly be the (+++) choice combinator that is used. For reasons of efficiency,
</p>
<p>
22
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
</p>
<p>
in the combinator libraries that accompany this article, the repetition combinators
from the previous section are defined using (+++) rather than (++).
We conclude this section by asking why first is defined by pattern matching,
rather than by using the selection function take :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] (where,
for example, take 3 "parsing" = "par"):
first p = \inp -&gt; take 1 (p inp)
The answer concerns the behaviour under lazy evaluation. To see the problem, let
us unfold the use of take in the above definition:
first p = \inp -&gt; case p inp of
[]
-&gt; []
(x:xs) -&gt; x : take 0 xs
When the sub-expression take 0 xs is evaluated, it will yield []. However, under
lazy evaluation this computation will be suspended until its value is required. The
effect is that the list xs may be retained in memory for some time, when in fact
it can safely be discarded immediately. This is an example of a space leak . The
definition of first using pattern matching does not suffer from this problem.
6 Handling lexical issues
Traditionally, a string to be parsed is not supplied directly to a parser, but is
first passed through a lexical analysis phase (or lexer) that breaks the string into
a sequence of tokens (Aho et al., 1986). Lexical analysis is a convenient place to
remove white-space (spaces, newlines, and tabs) and comments from the input
string, and to distinguish between identifiers and keywords.
Since lexers are just simple parsers, they can be built using parser combinators,
as discussed by Hutton (1992). However, as we shall see in this section, the need
for a separate lexer can often be avoided (even for substantial grammars such as
that for Gofer), with lexical issues being handled within the main parser by using
some special purpose combinators.
6.1 White-space, comments, and keywords
We begin by defining a parser that consumes white-space from the beginning of a
string, with a dummy value () returned as result:
spaces :: Parser ()
spaces = [() | _ &lt;- many1 (sat isSpace)]
where
isSpace x =
(x == ’ ’) || (x == ’\n’) || (x == ’\t’)
Similarly, a single-line Gofer comment can be consumed as follows:
comment :: Parser ()
comment = [() | _ &lt;- string "&ndash;"
, _ &lt;- many (sat (\x -&gt; x /= ’\n’))]
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
23
</p>
<p>
We leave it as an exercise for the reader to define a parser for consuming multi-line
Gofer comments {- &hellip; -}, which can be nested.
After consuming white-space, there may still be a comment left to consume from
the input string. Dually, after a comment there may still be white-space. Thus we
are motivated to defined a special parser that repeatedly consumes white-space and
comments until no more remain:
junk :: Parser ()
junk = [() | _ &lt;- many (spaces +++ comment)]
Note that while spaces and comment can fail, the junk parser always succeeds. We
define two combinators in terms of junk: parse removes junk before applying a
given parser, and token removes junk after applying a parser:
parse :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
parse p = [v | _ &lt;- junk, v &lt;- p]
token :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
token p = [v | v &lt;- p, _ &lt;- junk]
With the aid of these two combinators, parsers can be modified to ignore whitespace and comments. Firstly, parse is applied once to the parser as a whole, ensuring that input to the parser begins at a significant character. And secondly, token
is applied once to all sub-parsers that consume complete tokens, thus ensuring that
the input always remains at a significant character.
Examples of parsers for complete tokens are nat and int (for natural numbers
and integers), parsers of the form string xs (for symbols and keywords), and
ident (for identifiers). It is useful to define special versions of these parsers — and
more generally, special versions of any user-defined parsers for complete tokens —
that encapsulate the necessary application of token:
natural
natural
</p>
<p>
:: Parser Int
= token nat
</p>
<p>
integer
integer
</p>
<p>
:: Parser Int
= token int
</p>
<p>
symbol
symbol xs
</p>
<p>
:: String -&gt; Parser String
= token (string xs)
</p>
<p>
identifier
:: [String] -&gt; Parser String
identifier ks = token [x | x &lt;- ident, not (elem x ks)]
Note that identifier takes a list of keywords as an argument, where a keyword
is a string that is not permitted as an identifier. For example, in Gofer the strings
“data” and “where” (among others) are keywords. Without the keyword check,
parsers defined in terms of identifier could produce unexpected results, or involve
unnecessary backtracking to construct the correct parse of the input string.

6.2 A parser for λ-expressions
</p>
<p>
To illustrate the use of the new combinators given above, let us define a parser for
simple λ-expressions extended with a “let” construct for local definitions. Parsed
expressions will be represented in Gofer as follows:
data Expr =
</p>
<p>
App
Lam
Let
Var
</p>
<p>
Expr Expr
String Expr
String Expr Expr
String
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
application
lambda abstraction
local definition
variable
</p>
<p>
Now a parser expr :: Parser Expr can be defined by:
expr
</p>
<p>
= atom ‘chainl1‘ [App]
</p>
<p>
atom
</p>
<p>
= lam +++ local +++ var +++ paren
</p>
<p>
lam
</p>
<p>
= [Lam x e |
,
,
,
</p>
<p>
local
</p>
<p>
= [Let x e e’ |
,
,
,
,
,
</p>
<p>
var
</p>
<p>
= [Var x | x &lt;- variable]
</p>
<p>
paren
</p>
<p>
= bracket (symbol "(") expr (symbol ")")
</p>
<p>
_
x
_
e
</p>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-
</p>
<p>
symbol "\\"
variable
symbol "-&gt;"
expr]
</p>
<p>
_
x
_
e
_
e’
</p>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-
</p>
<p>
symbol "let"
variable
symbol "="
expr
symbol "in"
expr]
</p>
<p>
variable = identifier ["let","in"]
Note how the expr parser handles white-space and comments by using the symbol
parser in place of string and char. Similarly, the keywords “let” and “in” are
handled by using identifier to define the parser for variables. Finally, note how
applications (f e1 e2 &hellip; en) are parsed in the form (((f e1) e2) &hellip; ) by
using the chainl1 combinator.

7 Factorising the parser monad
Up to this point in the article, combinator parsers have been our only example of
the notion of a monad. In this section we define a number of other monads related
to the parser monad, leading up to a modular reformulation of the parser monad
in terms of two simpler monads (Jones, 1995a). The immediate benefit is that, as
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
25
</p>
<p>
we shall see, the basic parser combinators no longer need to be defined explicitly.
Rather, they arise automatically as a special case of lifting monad operations from
a base monad m to a certain other monad parameterised over m. This also means
that, if we change the nature of parsers by modifying the base monad (for example,
limiting parsers to producing at most one result), new combinators for the modified
monad of parsers are also defined automatically.
7.1 The exception monad
Before starting to define other monads, it is useful to first focus briefly on the
intuition behind the use of monads in functional programming (Wadler, 1992a).
The basic idea behind monads is to distinguish the values that a computation
can produce from the computation itself. More specifically, given a monad m and
a type a, we can think of m a as the type of computations that yield results of
type a, with the nature of the computation captured by the type constructor m.
The combinators result and bind (with zero and (++) if appropriate) provide a
means to structure the building of such computations:
result
bind
zero
(++)
</p>
<p>
::
::
::
::
</p>
<p>
m
m
m
m
</p>
<p>
a
a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
a
a -&gt; m a -&gt; m a
</p>
<p>
From a computational point of view, result converts values into computations
that yield those values; bind chains two computations together in sequence, with
results of the first computation being made available for use in the second; zero is
the trivial computation that does nothing; and finally, (++) is some kind of choice
operation for computations.
Consider, for example, the type constructor Maybe:
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
We can think of a value of type Maybe a as a computation that either succeeds with
a value of type a, or fails, producing no value. Thus, the type constructor Maybe
captures computations that have the possibility to fail.
Defining the monad combinators for a given type constructor is usually just a
matter of making the “obvious definitions” suggested by the types of the combinators. For example, the type constructor Maybe can be made into a monad with a
zero and plus using the following definitions:
instance Monad Maybe where
&ndash; result
:: a -&gt; Maybe a
result x
= Just x
&ndash; bind
:: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
(Just x) ‘bind‘ f = f x
Nothing ‘bind‘ f = Nothing
</p>
<p>
26
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
</p>
<p>
instance Monad0Plus Maybe where
&ndash; zero
:: Maybe a
zero
= Nothing
&ndash; (++)
Just x ++ y
Nothing ++ y
</p>
<p>
:: Maybe a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe a
= Just x
= y
</p>
<p>
That is, result converts a value into a computation that succeeds with this value;
bind is a sequencing operator, with a successful result from the first computation
being available for use in the second computation; zero is the computation that
fails; and finally, (++) is a (deterministic) choice operator that returns the first
computation if it succeeds, and the second otherwise.
Since failure can be viewed as a simple kind of exception, Maybe is sometimes
called the exception monad in the literature (Spivey, 1990).
7.2 The non-determinism monad
A natural generalisation of Maybe is the list type constructor []. While a value of
type Maybe a can be thought of as a computation that either succeeds with a single
result of type a or fails, a value of type [a] can be thought of as a computation
that has the possibility to succeed with any number of results of type a, including
zero (which represents failure). Thus the list type constructor [] can be used to
capture non-deterministic computations.
Now [] can be made into a monad with a zero and plus:
instance Monad [] where
&ndash; result
:: a -&gt; [a]
result x
= [x]
&ndash; bind
:: [a] -&gt; (a -&gt; [b]) -&gt; [b]
[]
‘bind‘ f = []
(x:xs) ‘bind‘ f = f x ++ (xs ‘bind‘ f)
instance Monad0Plus [] where
&ndash; zero
:: [a]
zero
= []
&ndash; (++)
[]
++ ys
(x:xs) ++ ys
</p>
<p>
:: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
= ys
= x : (xs ++ ys)
</p>
<p>
That is, result converts a value into a computation that succeeds with this single
value; bind is a sequencing operator for non-deterministic computations; zero always fails; and finally, (++) is a (non-deterministic) choice operator that appends
the results of the two argument computations.

</p>
<p>
7.3 The state-transformer monad
Consider the (binary) type constructor State:
type State s a = s -&gt; (a,s)
Values of type State s a can be interpreted as follows: they are computations that
take an initial state of type s, and yield a value of type a together with a new state
of type s. Thus, the type constructor State s obtained by applying State to a
single type s captures computations that involve state of type s. We will refer to
values of type State s a as stateful computations.
Now State s can be made into a monad:
instance Monad (State s) where
&ndash; result :: a -&gt; State s a
result v
= \s -&gt; (v,s)
&ndash; bind
:: State s a -&gt; (a -&gt; State s b) -&gt; State s b
st ‘bind‘ f = \s -&gt; let (v,s’) = st s in f v s’
That is, result converts a value into a stateful computation that returns that value
without modifying the internal state, and bind composes two stateful computations
in sequence, with the result value from the first being supplied as input to the
second. Thinking pictorially in terms of boxes and wires is a useful aid to becoming
familiar with these two operations (Jones &amp; Launchbury, 1994).
The state-transformer monad State s does not have a zero and a plus. However,
as we shall see in the next section, the parameterised state-transformer monad over
a given based monad m does have a zero and a plus, provided that m does.
To allow us to access and modify the internal state, a few extra operations on
the monad State s are introduced. The first operation, update, modifies the state
by applying a given function, and returns the old state as the result value of the
computation. The remaining two operations are defined in terms of update: set
replaces the state with a new state, and returns the old state as the result; fetch
returns the state without modifying it.
update
set
fetch
</p>
<p>
:: (s -&gt; s) -&gt; State s s
:: s -&gt; State s s
:: State s s
</p>
<p>
update f = \s -&gt; (s, f s)
set s
= update (_ -&gt; s)
fetch
= update id
In fact State s is not the only monad for which it makes sense to define these
operations. For this reason we encapsulate the extra operations in a class, so that
the same names can be used for the operations of different monads:
class Monad m =&gt; StateMonad m s where
update :: (s -&gt; s) -&gt; m s

This declaration can be read as follows: a type constructor m and a type s are
together a member of the class StateMonad if m is a member of the class Monad,
and if m is also equipped with update, set, and fetch operations of the specified
types. Moreover, the fact that set and fetch can be defined in terms of update is
also reflected in the declaration, by means of default definitions.
Now because State s is already a monad, it can be made into a state monad
using the update operation as defined earlier:
instance StateMonad (State s) s where
&ndash; update :: (s -&gt; s) -&gt; State s s
update f
= \s -&gt; (s, f s)
7.4 The parameterised state-transformer monad
Recall now our type of combinator parsers:
type Parser a = String -&gt; [(a,String)]
We see now that parsers combine two kinds of computation: non-deterministic computations (the result of a parser is a list), and stateful computations (the state is the
string being parsed). Abstracting from the specific case of returning a list of results,
the Parser type gives rise to a generalised version of the State type constructor
that applies a given type constructor m to the result of the computation:
type StateM m s a = s -&gt; m (a,s)
Now StateM m s can be made into a monad with a zero and a plus, by inheriting
the monad operations from the base monad m:
instance Monad m =&gt; Monad (StateM m s) where
&ndash; result
:: a -&gt; StateM m s a
result v
= \s -&gt; result (v,s)
&ndash; bind
:: StateM m s a -&gt;
-(a -&gt; StateM m s b) -&gt; StateM m s b
stm ‘bind‘ f = \s -&gt; stm s ‘bind‘ \(v,s’) -&gt; f v s’
instance Monad0Plus m =&gt; Monad0Plus (StateM m s) where
&ndash; zero
:: StateM m s a
zero
= \s -&gt; zero
&ndash; (++)
:: StateM m s a -&gt; StateM m s a -&gt; StateM m s a
stm ++ stm’ = \s -&gt; stm s ++ stm’ s
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
That is, result converts a value into a computation that returns this value without
modifying the internal state; bind chains two computations together; zero is the
computation that fails regardless of the input state; and finally, (++) is a choice
operation that passes the same input state through to both of the argument computations, and combines their results.
In the previous section we defined the extra operations update, set and fetch
for the monad State s. Of course, these operations can also be defined for the
parameterised state-transformer monad StateM m s. As previously, we only need
to define update, the remaining two operations being defined automatically via
default definitions:
instance Monad m =&gt; StateMonad (StateM m s) s where
&ndash; update :: Monad m =&gt; (s -&gt; s) -&gt; StateM m s s
update f
= \s -&gt; result (s, f s)
</p>
<p>
7.5 The parser monad revisited
Recall once again our type of combinator parsers:
type Parser a = String -&gt; [(a,String)]
This type can now be re-expressed using the parameterised state-transformer monad
StateM m s by taking [] for m, and String for s:
type Parser a = StateM [] String a
But why view the Parser type in this way? The answer is that all the basic parser
combinators no longer need to be defined explicitly (except one, the parser item for
single characters), but rather arise as an instance of the general case of extending
monad operations from a type constructor m to the type constructor StateM m s.
More specifically, since [] forms a monad with a zero and a plus, so does State []
String, and hence Gofer automatically provides the following combinators:
result
bind
zero
(++)
</p>
<p>
::
::
::
::
</p>
<p>
a -&gt; Parser a
Parser a -&gt; (a -&gt; Parser b) -&gt; Parser b
Parser a
Parser a -&gt; Parser a -&gt; Parser a
</p>
<p>
Moreover, defining the parser monad in this modular way in terms of StateM
means that, if we change the type of parsers, then new combinators for the modified
type are also defined automatically. For example, consider replacing
type Parser a = StateM [] String a
by a new definition in which the list type constructor [] (which captures nondeterministic computations that can return many results) is replaced by the Maybe
type constructor (which captures deterministic computations that either fail, returning no result, or succeed with a single result):
</p>
<p>
30
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
data Maybe a
</p>
<p>
= Just a | Nothing
</p>
<p>
type Parser a = StateM Maybe String a
Since Maybe forms a monad with a zero and a plus, so does the re-defined Parser
type constructor, and hence Gofer automatically provides result, bind, zero, and
(++) combinators for deterministic parsers. In earlier approaches that do not exploit
the monadic nature of parsers (Wadler, 1985; Hutton, 1992; Fokker, 1995), the basic
combinators would have to be re-defined by hand.
The only basic parsing primitive that does not arise from the monadic structure
of the Parser type is the parser item for consuming single characters:
item :: Parser Char
item = \inp -&gt; case inp of
[]
-&gt; []
(x:xs) -&gt; [(x,xs)]
However, item can now be re-defined in monadic style. We first fetch the current
state (the input string); if the string is empty then the item parser fails, otherwise
the first character is consumed (by applying the tail function to the state), and
returned as the result value of the parser:
item
</p>
<p>
= [x | (x:_) &lt;- update tail]
</p>
<p>
The advantage of the monadic definition of item is that it does not depend upon
the internal details of the Parser type. Thus, for example, it works equally well for
both the non-deterministic and deterministic versions of Parser.
8 Handling the offside rule
Earlier (section 6) we showed that the need for a lexer to handle white-space,
comments, and keywords can be avoided by using special combinators within the
main parser. Another task usually performed by a lexer is handling the Gofer offside
rule. This rule allows the grouping of definitions in a program to be indicated
using indentation, and is usually implemented by the lexer inserting extra tokens
(concerning indentation) into its output stream.
In this section we show that Gofer’s offside rule can be handled in a simple and
natural manner without a separate lexer, by once again using special combinators.
Our approach was inspired by the monadic view of parsers, and is a development
of an idea described earlier by Hutton (1992).
8.1 The offside rule
Consider the following simple Gofer program:
a = b + c
where
b = 10
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
31
</p>
<p>
c = 15 - 5
d = a * 2
It is clear from the use of indentation that a and d are intended to be global
definitions, with b and c local definitions to a. Indeed, the above program can be
viewed as a shorthand for the following program, in which the grouping of definitions
is made explicit using special brackets and separators:
{ a = b + c
where
{ b = 10
; c = 15 - 5 }
; d = a * 2 }
How the grouping of Gofer definitions follows from their indentation is formally
specified by the offside rule. The essence of the rule is as follows: consecutive definitions that begin in the same column c are deemed to be part of the same group.
To make parsing easier, it is further required that the remainder of the text of each
definition (excluding white-space and comments, of course) in a group must occur
in a column strictly greater than c. In terms of the offside rule then, definitions a
and d in the example program above are formally grouped together (and similarly
for b and c) because they start in the same column as one another.
8.2 Modifying the type of parsers
To implement the offside rule, we will have to maintain some extra information
during parsing. First of all, since column numbers play a crucial role in the offside
rule, parsers will need to know the column number of the first character in their
input string. In fact, it turns out that parsers will also require the current line
number. Thus our present type of combinator parsers,
type Parser a = StateM [] String a
is revised to the following type, in which the internal state of a parser now contains
a (line,column) position in addition to a string:
type Parser a = StateM [] Pstring a
type Pstring
</p>
<p>
= (Pos,String)
</p>
<p>
type Pos
</p>
<p>
= (Int,Int)
</p>
<p>
In addition, parsers will need to know the starting position of the current definition being parsed — if the offside rule is not in effect, this definition position can
be set with a negative column number. Thus our type of parsers is revised once
more, to take the current definition position as an extra argument:
type Parser a = Pos -&gt; StateM [] Pstring a
</p>
<p>
32
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
</p>
<p>
Another option would have been to maintain the definition position in the parser
state, along with the current position and the string to be parsed. However, definition positions can be nested, and supplying the position as an extra argument to
parsers — as opposed to within the parser state — is more natural from the point
of view of implementing nesting of positions.
Is the revised Parser type still a monad? Abstracting from the details, the body
of the Parser type definition is of the form s -&gt; m a (in our case s is Pos, m is the
monad StateM [] Pstring, and a is the parameter type a.) We recognise this as
being similar to the type s -&gt; m (a,s) of parameterised state-transformers, the
difference being that the type s of states no longer occurs in the type of the result:
in other words, the state can be read, but not modified. Thus we can think of s -&gt;
m a as the type of parameterised state-readers. The monadic nature of this type is
the topic of the next section.
8.3 The parameterised state-reader monad
Consider the type constructor ReaderM, defined as follows:
type ReaderM m s a = s -&gt; m a
In a similar way to StateM m s, ReaderM m s can be made into a monad with a
zero and a plus, by inheriting the monad operations from the base monad m:
instance Monad m =&gt; Monad (ReaderM m s) where
&ndash; result
:: a -&gt; ReaderM m s a
result v
= \s -&gt; result v
&ndash; bind
:: ReaderM m s a -&gt;
-(a -&gt; ReaderM m s b) -&gt; ReaderM m s b
srm ‘bind‘ f = \s -&gt; srm s ‘bind‘ \v -&gt; f v s
instance Monad0Plus m =&gt; Monad0Plus (ReaderM m s) where
&ndash; zero
:: ReaderM m s a
zero
= \s -&gt; zero
&ndash; (++)
:: ReaderM m s a -&gt;
-ReaderM m s a -&gt; ReaderM m s a
srm ++ srm’ = \s -&gt; srm s ++ srm’ s
That is, result converts a value into a computation that returns this value without
consulting the state; bind chains two computations together, with the same state
being passed to both computations (contrast with the bind operation for StateM,
in which the second computation receives the new state produced by the first computation); zero is the computation that fails; and finally, (++) is a choice operation
that passes the same state to both of the argument computations.
To allow us to access and set the state, a couple of extra operations on the
parameterised state-reader monad ReaderM m s are introduced. As for StateM, we
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
33
</p>
<p>
encapsulate the extra operations in a class. The operation env returns the state as
the result of the computation, while setenv replaces the current state for a given
computation with a new state:
class Monad m =&gt; ReaderMonad m s where
env
:: m s
setenv :: s -&gt; m a -&gt; m a
instance Monad m =&gt; ReaderMonad (ReaderM m s) s where
&ndash; env
:: Monad m =&gt; ReaderM m s s
env
= \s -&gt; result s
&ndash; setenv
:: Monad m =&gt; s -&gt;
-ReaderM m s a -&gt; ReaderM m s a
setenv s srm = _ -&gt; srm s
The name env comes from the fact that one can think of the state supplied to a
state-reader as being a kind of env ironment. Indeed, in the literature state-reader
monads are sometimes called environment monads.
8.4 The new parser combinators
Using the ReaderM type constructor, our revised type of parsers
type Parser a = Pos -&gt; StateM [] Pstring a
can now be expressed as follows:
type Parser a = ReaderM (StateM [] Pstring) Pos a
Now since [] forms a monad with a zero and a plus, so does StateM [] Pstring,
and hence so does ReaderM (StateM [] Pstring) Pos. Thus Gofer automatically
provides result, bind, zero, and (++) operations for parsers that can handle the
offside rule. Since the type of parsers is now defined in terms of ReaderM at the top
level, the extra operations env and setenv are also provided for parsers. Moreover,
the extra operation update (and the derived operations set and fetch) from the
underlying state monad can be lifted to the new type of parsers — or more generally,
to any parameterised state-reader monad — by ignoring the environment:
instance StateMonad m a =&gt; StateMonad (ReaderM m s) a where
&ndash; update :: StateMonad m a =&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; ReaderM m s a
update f
= _ -&gt; update f
Now that the internal state of parsers has been modified (from String to Pstring),
the parser item for consuming single characters from the input must also be modified. The new definition for item is similar to the old,
item :: Parser Char
item = [x | (x:_) &lt;- update tail]
</p>
<p>
34
</p>
<p>
Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer
</p>
<p>
except that the item parser now fails if the position of the character to be consumed
is not onside with respect to current definition position:
item :: Parser Char
item = [x | (pos,x:_) &lt;- update newstate
, defpos
&lt;- env
, onside pos defpos]
A position is onside if its column number is strictly greater than the current definition column. However, the first character of a new definition begins in the same
column as the definition column, so this is handled as a special case:
onside
:: Pos -&gt; Pos -&gt; Bool
onside (l,c) (dl,dc) = (c &gt; dc) || (l == dl)
The remaining auxiliary function, newstate, consumes the first character from the
input string, and updates the current position accordingly (for example, if a newline
character was consumed, the current line number is incremented, and the current
column number is set back to zero):
newstate :: Pstring -&gt; Pstring
newstate ((l,c),x:xs)
= (newpos,xs)
where
newpos = case x of
’\n’ -&gt; (l+1,0)
’\t’ -&gt; (l,((c ‘div‘ 8)+1)*8)
_
-&gt; (l,c+1)
One aspect of the offside rule still remains to be addressed: for the purposes
of this rule, white-space and comments are not significant, and should always be
successfully consumed even if they contain characters that are not onside. This can
be handled by temporarily setting the definition position to (0, −1) within the junk
parser for white-space and comments:
junk :: Parser ()
junk = [() | _ &lt;- setenv (0,-1) (many (spaces +++ comment))]
All that remains now is to define a combinator that parses a sequence of definitions subject to the Gofer offside rule:
many1<sub>offside</sub> :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many1<sub>offside</sub> p = [vs | (pos,_) &lt;- fetch
, vs
&lt;- setenv pos (many1 (off p))]
That is, many1 offside p behaves just as many1 (off p), except that within this
parser the definition position is set to the current position. (There is no need to
skip white-space and comments before setting the position, since this will already
have been effected by proper use of the lexical combinators token and parse.) The
auxiliary combinator off takes care of setting the definition position locally for
</p>
<p>
Monadic Parser Combinators
</p>
<p>
35
</p>
<p>
each new definition in the sequence, where a new definition begins if the column
position equals the definition column position:
off :: Parser a -&gt; Parser a
off p = [v | (dl,dc)
&lt;- env
, ((l,c),_) &lt;- fetch
, c == dc
, v
&lt;- setenv (l,dc) p]
For completeness, we also define a combinator many offside that has the same
behaviour as the combinator many1 offside, except that it can also parse an empty
sequence of definitions:
many<sub>offside</sub> :: Parser a -&gt; Parser [a]
many<sub>offside</sub> p = many1<sub>offside</sub> p +++ [[]]
To illustrate the use of the new combinators defined above, let us modify our
parser for λ-expressions (section 6.2) so that the “let” construct permits nonempty sequences of local definitions subject to the offside rule. The datatype Expr of
expressions is first modified so that the Let constructor has type [(String,Expr)]
-&gt; Expr instead of String -&gt; Expr -&gt; Expr:
data Expr = &hellip;
</p><table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left">Let [(String,Expr)] Expr</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">&hellip;</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The only part of the parser that needs to be modified is the parser local for local
definitions, which now accepts sequences:
local = [Let ds e |
,
,
,
defn

<p>
_
ds
_
e
</p>
<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-
</p>
<p>
symbol "let"
many1<sub>offside</sub> defn
symbol "in"
expr]
</p>
<p>
= [(x,e) | x &lt;- identifier
, _ &lt;- symbol "="
, e &lt;- expr]
</p>
<p>
We conclude this section by noting that the use of the offside rule when laying out
sequences of Gofer definitions is not mandatory. As shown in our initial example, one
also has the option to include explicit layout information in the form of parentheses
“{” and “}” around the sequence, with definitions separated by semi-colons “;”.
We leave it as an exercise to the reader to use many offside to define a combinator
that implements this convention.
In summary then, to permit combinator parsers to handle the Gofer offside rule,
we changed the type of parsers to include some positional information, modified
the item and junk combinators accordingly, and defined two new combinators:
many1 offside and many offside. All other necessary redefining of combinators
is done automatically by the Gofer type system.

10 Appendix: a parser for data definitions
To illustrate the monadic parser combinators developed in this article in a real-life
setting, we consider the problem of parsing a sequence of Gofer datatype definitions.
An example of such a sequence is as follows:
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
data Tree a b = Leaf a
</p><table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left">Node (Tree a b, b, Tree a b)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Within the parser, datatypes will be represented as follows:
type Data = (String,
[String],
[(String,[Type])])

<p>
&ndash; type name
&ndash; parameters
&ndash; constructors and arguments
</p>
<p>
The representation Type for types will be treated shortly. A parser datadecls ::

<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-

condecl ‘sepby1‘ symbol "|"]
</p>
<p>
constructor = token [(x:xs) | x &lt;- upper

<p>
= identifier ["data"]
</p>
<p>
condecl
</p>
<p>
= [(x,ts) | x &lt;- constructor
, ts &lt;- many type2]
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of points worth noting about this parser. Firstly, all lexical
issues (white-space and comments, the offside rule, and keywords) are handled by
combinators. And secondly, since constructor is a parser for a complete token, the
token combinator is applied within its definition.

where f [t] = t

<p>
Note how chainr1 and chainl1 are used to handle parsing of function-types and
application. Note also that (as in Gofer) building a singleton tuple (t) of a type t
is not possible, since (t) is treated as a parenthesised expression.
